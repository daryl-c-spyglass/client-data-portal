You are working ONLY on the CMA data layer and CMA search / result logic (NOT IDX or public search).

Goal:
Investigate and fix any status/filter mismatch between our CMA data (from Repliers/MLS feed) and the statuses that should be considered Active / Active Under Contract / Closed for the Cherry Creek subdivision.

We are using the attached CMA PDF “Quick CMA 2740” as a reference snapshot.

====================================================
1) Reproduce the CMA search & confirm what we return
====================================================

Reproduce the exact CMA search the user did:

- Status filter: Active (only)
- Subdivision: Cherry Creek
- Property type: Residential / Single Family
- Sqft range: 1200–1800 (per PDF footer)
- Date as-of: treat 2025-12-09 as the reference snapshot (matching the PDF timestamp).

Observed by user:
- Our CMA search (Active + Cherry Creek) returned:
  • 6303 Bexton CIR, Subdivision: Cherry Creek
- Zillow shows 6303 Bexton CIR as UNDER CONTRACT, not Active.

From the “Quick CMA 2740” PDF snapshot (as of 12/9/2025 10:48 am) the Active/UC/Closed sets are:

Active (3):
- 2301 Brookhill Dr, Cherry Creek, List Price $575,000
- 6502 Aldford Cir, Cherry Creek (Ph 06 Sec 01), List Price $500,000
- 7741 Manassas Dr, Cherry Creek (Ph 07 Sec 03), List Price $639,000

Active Under Contract (2):
- 6014 London Dr, Cherry Creek (Ph 06 Sec 02 Amd), List Price $474,900
- 5706 Cherry Creek Dr, Cherry Creek (Ph 02 Sec 03), List Price $509,900

Closed (4):
- 2714 Harleyhill Dr, Cherry Creek (Ph 04 Sec 02), Close Price $640,000
- 7906 Swindon Ln, Cherry Creek (Ph 07 Sec 06), Close Price $575,000
- 2803 Harleyhill Dr, Cherry Creek (Ph 04 Sec 02), Close Price $565,000
- 7803 Seminary Ridge Dr, Cherry Creek (Ph 07 Sec 03), Close Price $558,000

The user reports:
- The 3 “Active” addresses above match Zillow as Active.
- 6303 Bexton CIR shows as Active in our CMA search but Zillow shows it as Under Contract.
- PDF shows 4 Closed listings that appear correct.

====================================================
2) Investigate 6303 Bexton CIR status handling
====================================================

For 6303 Bexton CIR, Cherry Creek:

1) Pull the raw record(s) from our data source (Repliers or MLS feed):
   - Include ALL status-related fields:
     • StandardStatus
     • Status / MlsStatus / any local status field
     • Any “Under Contract” or “Pending” flags
     • Status change history if available
     • Modification/Originating modification timestamps

2) Determine:
   - What status we currently store for 6303 Bexton CIR (Active, Active Under Contract, Pending, etc.).
   - When that status last changed in our data vs when the CMA PDF snapshot (12/09/2025 10:48 am) was generated.
   - Whether this listing should be treated as:
     • Active
     • Active Under Contract
     • Pending
     • Or some derived “UC” status in the MLS mapping.

3) Compare against our CMA search logic:
   - Confirm whether the CMA “Active” filter is:
     • Strictly filtering on StandardStatus == "Active"
     • Or accidentally including “Active Under Contract” / “Pending” / “Contingent” as Active.
   - Confirm 6303 Bexton CIR is being selected because of:
     • Its current status in our DB, or
     • A mapping bug where an UC/Pending status is treated as Active.

4) Document whether any lag between our data and Zillow is expected or whether this is a logic/mapping bug on our side.

====================================================
3) Verify correctness of the 3 Active and 4 Closed listings in the PDF
====================================================

For each of the following properties:

Active:
- 2301 Brookhill Dr
- 6502 Aldford Cir
- 7741 Manassas Dr

Closed:
- 2714 Harleyhill Dr
- 7906 Swindon Ln
- 2803 Harleyhill Dr
- 7803 Seminary Ridge Dr

1) Pull raw data from our source:
   - Status fields (StandardStatus and local)
   - ListDate, CloseDate (for closed)
   - Modification timestamps.

2) Confirm that as of the CMA snapshot date/time (2025-12-09 10:48 am) our stored status agrees with:
   - The status in the PDF (Active / Active Under Contract / Closed)
   - Our current CMA UI classification.

3) Confirm that the CMA search/result logic is:
   - Using the same status filters that the PDF query used:
     • Active / Active Under Contract / Pending for the “Active/UC” sets.
     • Closed between 06/12/2025 and 12/09/2025 for the closed set (per PDF footer).

====================================================
4) Validate CMA search filters + PDF report filters are aligned
====================================================

We need to ensure that:

1) The CMA interactive search (UI) and the CMA report/PDF:
   - Use the same status filter rules for:
     • Active
     • Active Under Contract
     • Pending
     • Closed

2) Subdivision filter:
   - Confirm that the “Cherry Creek” filter in CMA:
     • Uses the same subdivision field and “like 'Cherry Creek*'” logic as the PDF query shows.
   - Verify 6303 Bexton CIR really matches this subdivision filter in our data.

3) Time & Sqft filter:
   - Confirm CMA filters respect:
     • Close date range 06/12/2025 – 12/09/2025 for Closed listings.
     • SqFt range 1200–1800 (as shown in PDF footer).
   - If CMA UI uses a different date/size window than the PDF, document differences.

====================================================
5) Fixes & Safeguards (if a bug is confirmed)
====================================================

If you confirm that 6303 Bexton CIR should be treated as Under Contract (or not Active):

1) Fix the mapping/filter logic so:
   - CMA “Active” search does NOT include:
     • Active Under Contract
     • Pending
     • Other non-true-active statuses.

2) Ensure CMA “Active Under Contract” and “Closed” searches:
   - Correctly pick up those statuses.

3) Add tests:
   - Unit or integration tests that:
     • Given a record with status "Active Under Contract" (or equivalent field from our source), it is:
       - NOT returned in an “Active only” CMA search.
       - Returned in an “Active Under Contract” CMA search.
     • For Cherry Creek, ensure 2301 Brookhill / 6502 Aldford / 7741 Manassas show under Active, and the 4 known closed addresses show under Closed.

====================================================
6) Required output / report
====================================================

In your final notes, please describe:

1) What status and timestamps our data source has for 6303 Bexton CIR.
2) Whether our CMA “Active” filter logic was incorrectly including UC/Pending statuses.
3) Whether the 3 Active and 4 Closed listings in the PDF are correctly represented in CMA searches.
4) Any code changes made to:
   - Status mapping
   - CMA search filters
   - PDF query generation
5) Any added tests to prevent this kind of status mismatch in the future.
