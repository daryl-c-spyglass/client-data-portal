## INQUIRY ONLY — Audit Buyer Search Fields and Repliers API Mapping

### CONTEXT

The Buyer Search page has many filter fields requiring extensive scrolling. Before improving the UI/UX, we need to understand:
1. What fields currently exist
2. Which fields actually map to Repliers API parameters
3. Which fields are used vs. unused
4. How the search query is built

---

### TASK 1: List All Current Filter Fields

Find and document every filter field in the Buyer Search UI:

**File:** `client/src/pages/BuyerSearch.tsx`

Create a complete inventory:
#Field NameInput TypeSectionRequired?1Status (Active, Under Contract, Closed)ToggleStatusNo2............

Group by section (e.g., Status, Location, Price, Property Details, Features, etc.)

---

### TASK 2: Map Fields to Repliers API Parameters

For each field, document:
1. What Repliers API parameter it maps to
2. Whether the mapping is confirmed working
3. Any transformation applied (e.g., UI value → API value)

Check against:
- Repliers API documentation
- The actual API call being made in the code
- `server/routes.ts` or wherever the Repliers query is built

---

### TASK 3: Identify Unused or Non-Functional Fields

Find any fields that:
1. Exist in UI but don't map to any API parameter
2. Map to API but Repliers doesn't support that filter
3. Are always ignored in the query builder

---

### TASK 4: Document Current Search Flow

Explain how the search works:

1. User fills filters → Where is state stored?
2. User clicks "Search Properties" → What function is called?
3. How is the API query built? (show the query builder logic)
4. What endpoint is called? (`/api/repliers/listings`? `/api/properties/search`?)
5. How are results displayed?

---

### TASK 5: Analyze Field Usage Patterns

If possible, identify:
1. Which fields are most commonly used (based on code defaults or logic)
2. Which fields are "advanced" and rarely needed
3. Which fields have the most impact on search results

---

### TASK 6: Document UI Structure

Describe the current layout:

1. How are filters organized? (single column, sections, tabs?)
2. What is the scroll depth? (how many viewport heights?)
3. Are there any collapsible sections?
4. Is there a "Show More Filters" / "Advanced" toggle?
