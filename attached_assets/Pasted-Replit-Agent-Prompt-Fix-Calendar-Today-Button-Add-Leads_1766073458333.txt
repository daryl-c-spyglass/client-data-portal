Replit Agent Prompt — Fix Calendar “Today” Button + Add Leads Name Filter (A–Z / Z–A + Infinite Scroll)

You are working in the existing Mission Control web app.

1) Calendar Section — “Today” Button is not working (FIX)
Issue

Clicking the Today button does not jump the calendar back to today/current period.

Requirements

Make Today work in all view modes:

Month view → jump to the current month and highlight today

Week view → jump to the week containing today

Day view → jump to today

List view → reset the internal anchor date to today and reload the visible range

Keep existing filters (Agent), sort selection, and view mode unchanged.

After clicking Today, refresh the calendar data for the new visible date range.

Implementation guidance

Use a single source of truth date state such as anchorDate.

On Today click: setAnchorDate(new Date())

Recompute the date range from anchorDate depending on the active view mode.

Ensure the UI month label updates correctly (e.g., Dec 2025 → current month).

Acceptance test

Navigate to another month (e.g., Dec 2025), click Today → returns to current month/week/day depending on view.

2) Leads Section — Add “Lead Name” filter with sorting (A–Z default, Z–A option) + show ALL names on scroll
Goal

Create a filter in the Leads section that lets users filter/sort by Lead Name:

Default sort: A → Z

Add option: Z → A

Ensure all leads names load as the user scrolls to the bottom (no limited list).

Requirements
A) UI

Add a “Lead Name” sorting control (dropdown or toggle) with:

A → Z (default)

Z → A

Default should load and display leads alphabetically by name.

B) Data behavior

Ensure the results include all leads, not just the first page:

Implement infinite scroll or “Load more” that triggers automatically when the user reaches the bottom.

Continue fetching the next page until there are no more results.

Sorting must remain consistent across pages:

Either:

Fetch all pages first, then sort client-side (only if total size is reasonable), OR

If the API supports server-side sort by name, use it consistently with pagination.

C) Technical requirements

Do not break existing lead filters (assigned agent, status, etc.)

Avoid duplicate records when loading more pages.

Add a loading indicator at bottom while fetching more.

Add empty state if no leads match.

Acceptance tests

Leads list initially shows names in A–Z.

Switching to Z–A reorders results correctly.

Scrolling to the bottom loads more leads until all are shown (no “missing names”).

Deliverables

Provide the exact file paths changed.

Confirm Today works in Calendar.

Confirm Leads name sorting works and infinite scroll loads the full dataset.
