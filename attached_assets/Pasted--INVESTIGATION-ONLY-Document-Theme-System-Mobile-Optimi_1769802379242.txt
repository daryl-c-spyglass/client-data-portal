## IMPORTANT NOTES

1. **DO NOT MAKE ANY CHANGES** - This is investigation/documentation only
2. Document what EXISTS, not what should exist
3. Be specific about file paths and line numbers
4. Include complete code blocks for the theme system
5. For mobile audit, test actual behavior if possible or inspect code
6. Flag any inconsistencies between sections
7. Note any missing theme support in components
8. Identify components that don't use the ThemeContext properly

---

## QUESTIONS TO ANSWER

### Theme System
1. Is there ONE centralized ThemeContext or multiple?
2. Does theme persist across page refreshes (localStorage)?
3. Does theme sync with server/user preferences?
4. Does "system" mode properly detect OS preference?
5. Are all components using the theme consistently?

### Mobile Optimization
1. Which sections have the best mobile support?
2. Which sections need the most work?
3. Are there any components missing touch support entirely?
4. Are there hardcoded widths causing horizontal scroll?
5. Are there hover-only interactions without touch alternatives?

**After this investigation, we will create a unified fix prompt based on the findings.**
