I’m continuing work on the CMA Builder / Search Properties flow. This prompt is in addition to my previous instructions; please treat these as extra requirements, not a replacement.
=============================================
A) Search Properties – Filters & Behavior


Property Type Filter (New)


In Create New CMA → Search Properties, add a Property Type dropdown with these options:


Any


Single Family Residential


Condominium


Townhouse


Multi-Family


Land


Behavior:


This must be a functional filter that maps to the correct Repliers fields (propertySubType / propertyType, etc.).


When “Any” is selected, keep current behavior (no type restriction).


For all other values, limit results to that specific category.




City & Subdivision Autocomplete STILL Not Working




The suggestive/autocomplete output for City and Subdivision is still not appearing when I type.


Please wire these fields to the same autocomplete logic and data source used elsewhere (Buyer Search / Seller Updates).


As the user types, show suggestions from Repliers/DB.


User should be able to:


Select from suggestions, or


Type a full custom value.






Cherry Creek Counts vs Repliers


Using Search Properties with:


City: Austin


Subdivision: Cherry Creek


Status: Active → Only 1 result is found


Status: Sold/Closed → 0 results


Status: Under Contract → 20 results


Please:


Verify these counts against the actual Repliers data source.


Confirm that status, subdivision, and filters are mapped correctly (same issue as in my Cherry Creek Quick CMA reference).


Fix any mismatches in query or normalization so results accurately reflect Repliers.




Listing Date + Status Text on Search Results Cards


In the Search Results (X found) list:


For Sold properties:


Show Listing Date first, then Sold Date.




For non-sold properties (Active, Under Contract):


Show Listing Date, followed by a green text label:


Example: Active (in green) or Under Contract (in a distinct, appropriate style).








Clicking Search Result → Floating Detail Card


Currently when I click a search result card, nothing meaningful happens.
Required behavior:


Clicking a result card should open a floating overlay card (or slide-out) that shows:


Property photos (gallery)


Full address


Beds / baths


Living area (sqft)


Price


Listing date, status, any key details available from Repliers




This information should come from the same normalized Repliers data used in the Properties section.


The card should be fully clickable and allow:


“Set as Subject”


“Add as Comparable”


Without closing or breaking the overlay.






Status vs Sold Date (Under Contract)




When I filter Status = Under Contract, search results are still showing Sold Date, which is misleading.


For Under Contract listings:


Do not show Sold Date.


Show listing date and/or contract date (or just listing date + “Under Contract”).






Sorting by Listing Date (Active & Under Contract)


In Search Results, when the filter includes Active and/or Under Contract:


Sort the results by Listing Date, newest to oldest.


This should be the default ordering for these statuses.




Comparable Properties – Max Count = 5


In the Comparable Properties section:


Limit the number of comparables to 5 (not 6).


If the user tries to add more than 5:


Prevent the action and optionally show a small message like:


“You can add up to 5 comparable properties.”








Clear Filters / Reset Button


In the upper right of the Search Properties area:


Add a “Clear Filters” / “Reset” control.


Clicking it should:


Reset all filter fields (City, Subdivision, Status, Sold Date, property type, etc.) back to defaults.


Clear Search Results list and Subject/Comparable selection if appropriate (use the same behavior we have elsewhere for reset).






Images & Carousel




In Search Results:


Thumbnails for properties are still not showing.


Make sure each card uses the first photo from Repliers (photos/media array) as a thumbnail.




When the user clicks into a property (floating card / detail view):


Show all available photos in a carousel.


Allow the user to click/scroll through multiple images.






Generate Report – Next Step




After the user finishes selecting Subject and Comparables and the search section is complete:


The “Generate Report” flow should clearly be the next step.


Clicking it should:


Use the chosen filters and selected comparables.


Navigate directly to the CMA calculations/report pages (Home Averages, Listings, Timeline, Market Stats).






=============================================
B) Yellow Box & Report Actions
In the yellow bar at the top of the CMA report:


Remove Link Icon (Duplicate Share)




The small link icon in the yellow box should be removed, because sharing is already handled by the Share button in the upper right.


Avoid redundant share controls.




PDF Output – Remove Yellow Strip




When using the Printer / PDF functionality:


Remove the yellow preview strip (“You are seeing a preview of the report…”) from the PDF output.


The printed PDF should look clean and client-facing, without internal preview messaging.






Share Button Preview = Same as PDF




The Share button (upper right) should:


Show a preview that matches the PDF content.


The public/shared view should be effectively the same layout as what’s printed, just in web form.






Notes Option




The Notes option seems to have disappeared / is not visible.


Please:


Restore the Notes feature (if it was removed),


Or clearly expose where Notes live in the UI.




Notes should still be tied to the CMA and be accessible from the CMA report.


=============================================
C) Tab Help Icons & Market Stats Enhancements
For the four main CMA tabs:


Home Averages


Listings


Timeline


Market Stats




Info / Help Icons




Add a small info icon near each tab title.


On hover or click, show a brief explanation of:


What data this tab is showing.


How the data is calculated (e.g., averages based on selected comparables, etc.).






Market Stats – Show Filters & Status Breakdown


In Market Stats:


Market Stats should reflect the same filters and comparables the user used in the CMA.


Show a clear breakdown by status and property type:


Active


Under Contract


Closed/Sold




For each segment, show:


Counts and key metrics (price, DOM, $/sqft, etc.)


Indicate the property type(s) being included (Single Family, Condo, etc.) so it’s obvious what the stats represent.




Please implement all of the above while keeping the existing UX look-and-feel. Focus on wiring the filters correctly to Repliers, fixing the data mapping, and improving the CMA workflow and report usability.
