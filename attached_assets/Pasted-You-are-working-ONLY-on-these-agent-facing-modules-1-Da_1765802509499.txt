You are working ONLY on these agent-facing modules:
1) Dashboard
2) Properties
3) CMA Results (Print PDF)
4) Buyer Search

Data source: Repliers only.
Leasing/rental listings must be excluded globally from all pulls, counts, widgets, and comps.

Implement items ONE BY ONE, test each, and provide a final report.

====================================================
A) DASHBOARD — MAKE SUMMARY CARDS CLICKABLE (REDIRECTION ONLY)
====================================================

Requirement (no redesign):
Make these Dashboard summary cards clickable and redirect to the correct sections:

1) “Total Properties” → redirect to Properties module
2) “Active CMAs” → redirect to CMAs section
3) “Seller Updates” → redirect to Seller Updates section

Notes:
- Keep existing styling; just add clickability + routing.
- Ensure accessibility: cursor pointer + keyboard navigation (Enter/Space) if possible.

Testing:
- Click each card and confirm correct redirection.

====================================================
B) DASHBOARD — RECENT SOLD/CLOSED STILL EMPTY (PERSONALIZED + FALLBACK)
====================================================

Problem:
- Recent Sold/Closed widget is empty.

Requirements:
1) Populate Recent Sold/Closed using this logic:
   a) If user has recent activity (recent searches in Properties, CMA, Buyer Search):
      - Use their most recent search context (city/subdivision/criteria) to pull sold/closed listings.
   b) If no recent activity exists:
      - Default to the most recent sold/closed listings overall (most recent close date).

2) List behavior:
- Sorted newest close date first.
- Show Sold Date explicitly per property.
- Each item must be clickable and open the floating property card.

3) Floating property card requirements:
- Must show complete property info + images.
- Images:
  - Auto-carousel every 3 seconds
  - Manual navigation:
    • click left side = previous
    • click right side = next
  - If no images: show “No photos available”

4) Rentals/leasing must be excluded (do not show rent-like closed prices).

Testing:
- With recent search context present:
  - Confirm Recent Sold/Closed uses that context.
- With no context:
  - Confirm it defaults to most recent sold/closed.
- Click a sold item:
  - Floating card opens and carousel works.
  - Sold Date is visible.

====================================================
C) PROPERTIES — DATE RANGE MONTH/YEAR ADJUSTABLE + SOLD DATE QUICK FILTERS
====================================================

Problems:
- Date Range is not adjustable.
- Need Sold Date quick range filters like CMA.

Requirements:
1) Date Range controls:
- Make Month and Year adjustable/changeable (dropdowns or date picker).
- Ensure user can set a valid start/end month+year.
- Preserve selection when switching views unless Reset is clicked.

2) Sold Date quick filters (place BELOW Date Range):
Add selectable options:
- 0–30
- 0–60
- 0–90
- 0–120
- 0–150
- 0–180

Rules:
- These apply ONLY to Sold/Closed listings (close date).
- If user selects Sold Date quick filter, it should update the effective date range accordingly.
- If user selects multiple statuses including non-sold, sold-date filter should only affect sold/closed portion OR clearly disable it unless sold is selected (pick one and implement consistently).

Testing:
- Change month/year and confirm results reflect changes.
- Select Sold Date 0–30 and confirm results are limited to last 30 days of sold/closed.

====================================================
D) CMA RESULTS — PRINT PDF STILL CUT OFF (BOTTOM) + SOLD/COMP TESTING (AUSTIN)
====================================================

Problem:
- CMA PDF output is cut off at the bottom.

Requirements:
1) Fix print layout so nothing is clipped:
- Remove fixed-height containers and overflow scroll behaviors for print.
- Add proper page breaks between sections/cards.
- Ensure all content flows into additional pages as needed.
- Remove any UI-only toolbars and overlays from print output.

2) Testing requirement (must do):
- In Austin, test comparables for Sold/Closed:
  - Choose 3–5 sold/closed addresses from Austin and generate CMA PDF.
  - Confirm:
    • No cut-off bottom clipping
    • Sold comps appear correctly
    • Multi-page PDF renders like a document

3) Report must include the tested addresses (3–5) and results.

====================================================
E) BUYER SEARCH — ADD SOLD DATE QUICK FILTERS BELOW DATE RANGE
====================================================

Requirement:
- Add “Sold Date” quick filters BELOW Date Range in Buyer Search:
  - 0–30
  - 0–60
  - 0–90
  - 0–120
  - 0–150
  - 0–180

Rules:
- Must apply to sold/closed listings by close date.
- Must work with existing filters and not break Save Search.

Testing:
- Select Sold Date 0–60 and confirm results match last 60 days sold/closed for the search area.

====================================================
F) PROVIDE CURRENT STATUS OF REPLIERS INTEGRATION
====================================================

In the final report, include:
- Which Repliers endpoints are being used for:
  • Properties search
  • Buyer Search
  • CMA comps (active/uc/sold)
  • Dashboard totals and Recent Sold/Closed
- Authentication method in use (server-side key, headers)
- Last successful sync timestamp (if applicable)
- Known limitations (e.g., data freshness lag)

====================================================
G) QUESTIONS FOR REPLIERS (IF NEEDED)
====================================================

If inconsistencies persist after fixes, prepare a short list of questions for Repliers support, such as:
1) Status freshness:
   - How quickly do status changes propagate (Active → UC → Sold)?
2) Sold/Closed close date reliability:
   - Which field should be trusted as CloseDate?
3) Subdivision field mapping:
   - Which field is authoritative for subdivision vs neighborhood?
4) Photos availability for sold listings:
   - Are sold listing photos included or restricted?
5) Rate limits / pagination:
   - Any constraints that could cause empty results on multi-status searches?

====================================================
FINAL REPORT REQUIRED
====================================================

Provide:
- Proof of dashboard card redirections working.
- Proof Recent Sold/Closed is populated (personalized + fallback).
- Proof Properties date range and sold-date filters work.
- Proof Buyer Search sold-date filters work.
- Proof CMA PDF no longer cut off + include 3–5 Austin sold comps tested.
- Repliers integration status summary + recommended questions (if needed).
