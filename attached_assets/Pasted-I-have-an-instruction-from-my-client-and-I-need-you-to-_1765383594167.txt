I have an instruction from my client, and I need you to apply the following updates and corrections to the project.

==================================================
CLIENT INSTRUCTION – APPLY THESE FIXES
==================================================

1) The CMA function must produce accurate results that match real-world CMAs.
   - My client provided a Quick CMA example for Cherry Creek.
   - When I select the same subdivision and comp criteria, the system should generate the same (or very close) results.
   - Fix all math and mapping issues that cause incorrect averages, medians, or $/sqft.

2) When entering a subdivision (e.g., “Cherry Creek”), the search should:
   • Show Active and Under Contract listings if they exist  
   • Show Closed listings correctly  
   • Pull all listings from Repliers, not MLS Grid  
   • Reproduce the same comps used in the provided Quick CMA  

3) Ensure property data (images, details, amenities, descriptions) is being pulled from Repliers.
   - Photos must appear on the list view and property detail pages.
   - Descriptions, features & amenities, history, and neighborhood must populate correctly.
   - The system must NEVER show placeholders unless Repliers truly has no data.

4) Status Mapping must match Repliers:
   • A = Active  
   • U = Active Under Contract  
   • P = Pending  
   • S = Sold  
   Make sure these statuses display correctly in Properties, CMA Builder, and Seller Updates.

5) Fix search filters for:
   • Subdivision  
   • Square footage range  
   • Property type / subtype  
   • Zip code / city / neighborhood  
   All should use Repliers data and should return proper results.

6) The system should not produce incorrect outputs like:
   - Showing 0 listings when they exist  
   - Showing incorrect averages like $575k when comps are $3M+  
   Fix normalization, numeric parsing, and calculation logic.

7) Ensure the app is using Repliers as the ONLY data source for:
   • Active listings  
   • Under Contract listings  
   • Sold listings (when available)  
   • CMA data  
   • Photos & listing details  

==================================================
ADDITIONAL FIXES REQUIRED (from testing)
==================================================

8) “Back to Search” on property detail pages should return to the previous Properties search results — NOT to Buyer Search.

9) Property detail page must load:
   • Gallery images  
   • Description  
   • Features & amenities  
   • Proper neighborhood info  
   • Accurate bed/bath/living area/year built  

10) CMA Builder must:
   - Use correct fields: listPrice, closePrice, livingArea, beds, baths, DOM  
   - Calculate averages, medians, and $/sqft correctly  
   - Match the provided Quick CMA when selecting the same comps  

==================================================
FILES PROVIDED
==================================================
You have access to:
• Quick CMA PDF for Cherry Creek  
• Multiple screenshots showing missing data, missing images, and search errors  
• Repliers documentation (already used earlier in this project)

Use these references to correct the implementation.

==================================================
SUMMARY  
==================================================
Please:

- Fix CMA accuracy  
- Fix subdivision search and status filtering  
- Ensure all data comes from Repliers and is fully mapped  
- Restore full property images and all property details  
- Fix “Back to Search” navigation  
- Validate against the Cherry Creek Quick CMA example  

DO NOT change UI layout or styling — only fix logic, mapping, data flow, and calculations.
