Replit Agent Prompt — Leads Tab: Agent Insights (Birthday, Home Anniversary, Activity) + Make Tags Clickable

The Leads section is still missing required features from the previous prompt. This task is to fully implement those missing items and fix tag visibility/usability.

1) Leads Tab — Agent Insights (MUST IMPLEMENT)
Goal

In the Leads tab (left navigation), surface agent-specific insights pulled from Follow Up Boss (FUB).

Required data (per agent)

When an agent is selected (or when “All agents” is selected and grouped):

Agent Birthday

Agent Home Anniversary

Recent Activity (from FUB timeline)

UI Requirements

Add an Agent Insights panel at the top of the Leads page (or in the right column if available).

Display:

🎂 Birthday (formatted date or “Not on file”)

🏠 Home Anniversary (formatted date or “Not on file”)

📌 Recent Activity (last 10 items max)

Activity type (call, email, text, note, task, etc.)

Timestamp

Related lead name (if applicable)

Behavior

If All agents is selected:

Show a grouped list OR

Require selecting a specific agent to view insights (acceptable, but must be explicit in UI).

Switching the agent filter must refresh the insights panel.

If data does not exist, show a clear empty state (not blank).

2) FUB API — Data Requirements (NO MOCKS)
You must:

Use real FUB API endpoints (same auth already used for Leads list).

Pull:

Agent profile data (birthday if available)

Custom fields for home anniversary (if stored as custom field — document key used)

Recent activity / timeline events

Add server routes if missing:

GET /api/fub/agent/:agentId/profile

GET /api/fub/agent/:agentId/activity?limit=10

Normalize responses before sending to UI.

3) Make Lead Tags (+7, +11, etc.) Visible & Clickable (MUST FIX)
Problem

Leads currently show +7, +11, etc., but users cannot see or interact with those tags.

Required behavior

These numbers represent hidden tags.

Clicking +N must:

Open a popover / modal

Display the full list of tags for that lead

Tags must be:

Clearly readable

Scrollable if long

Dismissible (click outside / close button)

Optional enhancement (recommended)

Make individual tags clickable to:

Filter leads by that tag

Or copy tag text

4) UX & Accessibility Rules (STRICT)

No silent failures

No hidden data without explanation

Loading states for:

Agent insights

Activity feed

Error state if FUB fails:

“Unable to load agent insights. Retry.”

5) Acceptance Criteria (ALL MUST PASS)

✅ Agent Birthday is visible (or “Not on file”)
✅ Home Anniversary is visible (or “Not on file”)
✅ Recent Activity shows real FUB events
✅ Switching agents updates the panel
✅ Clicking +N shows full tag list
✅ No raw +7 / +11 without interaction
✅ No mock/demo data

6) Deliverables

File paths changed

FUB endpoints used (documented in code comments)

Screenshot showing:

Agent Insights panel

Clicked tag popover with full tag list

Important

If any of the above cannot be implemented due to missing FUB fields, do not skip it.
Instead:

Surface a visible placeholder

Add a code comment explaining what field is missing and why

This task is not complete until all acceptance criteria are met.
