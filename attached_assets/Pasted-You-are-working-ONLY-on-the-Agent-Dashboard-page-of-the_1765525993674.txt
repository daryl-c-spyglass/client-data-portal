You are working ONLY on the Agent Dashboard page of the application (NOT CMA pages, IDX pages, or public search).

Scope:
- Dashboard landing page UI and data
- Metrics cards
- Quick Actions
- Recent CMA list
- Market / property widgets
- Dashboard personalization settings

Data source:
- All property and status data must come from Repliers.

====================================================
1) FIX DASHBOARD LANDING METRICS
====================================================

Problem:
- “Total Properties” count looks unrealistic.
- Status breakdown below it is incorrect.
- Under Contract is not included.

Requirements:
1. Recalculate “Total Properties” using Repliers data:
   - Total Properties = Active + Under Contract + Sold/Closed
2. Display a clear breakdown:
   - Active
   - Under Contract
   - Sold/Closed
3. Ensure numbers match the same logic used in CMA search and filters.
4. Add tooltips to explain what each count represents.

====================================================
2) QUICK ACTIONS – LAYOUT & LABEL FIXES
====================================================

Problem:
- Quick Actions layout is unbalanced and icons are unclear.

Requirements:
1. Move **Create CMA** button to the RIGHT side of Quick Actions.
2. Change “Search Properties” icon to a **magnifying glass**.
3. Move “Search Properties” to the RIGHT side as well.
4. Rename “Sync MLS Data” to **“Sync Repliers Data”**.
5. Ensure consistent button size, spacing, and visual hierarchy.

====================================================
3) RECENT CMAs – MOVE TO BOTTOM
====================================================

Problem:
- Recent CMAs list dominates the top of the dashboard.

Requirements:
1. Move **Recent CMAs** section to the **bottom** of the dashboard.
2. Keep it collapsible if space is limited.
3. Ensure newest CMA appears at the top of the list.

====================================================
4) REMOVE CMA ACTIVITY GRAPH
====================================================

Problem:
- CMA Activity graph provides limited value.

Requirements:
- Remove the **CMA Activity (Last 12 Months)** graph entirely.
- Reclaim the space for more actionable content.

====================================================
5) ADD ACTIVE PROPERTIES CAROUSEL (CLICKABLE)
====================================================

Requirements:
1. Add a **carousel of Active properties** to the dashboard.
2. Each carousel card must show:
   - Property image (from Repliers)
   - Address
   - Price
   - Beds / Baths / Sq Ft
   - Status badge
3. Clicking a property:
   - Opens the SAME floating card/modal used in CMA and Search Results.
4. Carousel behavior:
   - Auto-slide every few seconds
   - Manual navigation allowed

====================================================
6) PERSONALIZED PROPERTIES FOR REPEAT USERS
====================================================

Requirements:
1. For returning users:
   - Populate the Active Properties carousel dynamically based on:
     • Recent CMA searches
     • Recent buyer searches
2. If no recent activity exists:
   - Fall back to:
     • Recently active listings
     • Or system-wide featured listings

====================================================
7) DASHBOARD CONFIGURATION (USER-CONTROLLED)
====================================================

Requirements:
1. Add a **“Customize Dashboard”** option.
2. Allow users/agents to:
   - Show / hide dashboard widgets
   - Reorder sections (drag & drop or up/down controls)
3. Save preferences per user.
4. Default layout should apply to new users.

====================================================
8) FINAL TESTING & VALIDATION
====================================================

You MUST test:
1. Metrics match Repliers data and CMA logic.
2. Quick Actions layout and icons are correct.
3. Active Properties carousel:
   - Loads data
   - Opens floating cards correctly
4. Returning user sees personalized properties.
5. Dashboard customization persists after refresh/logout.

====================================================
FINAL REPORT REQUIRED
====================================================

Provide:
1. Before/after screenshots.
2. Exact data logic used for Total Properties.
3. List of dashboard widgets and which are configurable.
4. Confirmation no CMA, IDX, or public pages were affected.
