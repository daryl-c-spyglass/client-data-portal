Animated Transitions + Line Progress + Click-to-Zoom)

We have a Dashboard section called Marketing Insights with multiple graphs/charts. Implement a Slider Revolution-style interactive experience:

Goals

Marketing Insights must be a carousel of chart “slides”.

Add a thin line pagination/progress indicator (multiple small lines, one per slide) that animates and changes as slides change.

Add smooth slide transitions (fade/slide/scale with easing).

Make each chart clickable to open an expanded floating card (modal) where users can view/zoom the chart and read supporting metrics.

Required UX Behaviors
A) Carousel behavior

Supports next/prev arrows, swipe/drag (if applicable), and clicking pagination lines.

Tracks activeIndex and slideCount from the rendered slides (no hardcoding).

B) Line pagination / progress indicator (like the thin lines in the screenshot)

Render a horizontal row of thin rounded lines under the carousel.

One line per slide.

Inactive line: muted gray track.

Active line: darker primary fill.

Animate active line:

On slide change, reset the fill to 0% then animate to 100% over 300–600ms (or match your transition duration).

Click any line → jump to that slide.

Add a11y: aria-label="Go to insight slide X".

C) Slide transitions

On slide change: animate the slide content in using one of:

fade + slight translateY

fade + slight scale

Use CSS transitions or Framer Motion if already installed.

Keep motion subtle and performant (no heavy effects that slow charts).

D) Click-to-zoom floating card modal

Clicking a chart slide opens a modal overlay:

Large chart (expanded)

Title + subtitle (date range / filters if available)

Breakdown metrics (totals, MLS vs Repliers if relevant)

Close button + ESC + click outside to close

The expanded view should reuse the same chart component with a prop like variant="expanded" for size/tooling changes.

Implementation constraints

Do not break existing data filtering logic.

Do not hardcode the slide count; derive from the list of insight cards.

Ensure the indicator stays in sync even when data changes (filters, re-render).

If the project uses shadcn/ui:

Use Carousel (Embla) and Dialog.

If not, implement a minimal carousel with scroll snapping + state tracking.

Deliverables

List all files modified

Explain how activeIndex is tracked

Confirm the line indicator is animated + clickable

Confirm modal opens from any slide and supports zoom/expanded info

Now implement these enhancements end-to-end in the Marketing Insights section.
