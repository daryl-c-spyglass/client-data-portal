You are working ONLY on the AGENT APP (Dashboard, Properties, CMA Print PDF, Buyer Search, Navigation/Settings).
Do NOT modify IDX/public pages.

Data source: Repliers. Leasing/rentals excluded globally.
Implement items ONE BY ONE, test each, and provide a final report.

====================================================
A) DASHBOARD — RECENT SOLD/CLOSED FLOATING CARD FIXES
====================================================

Problems:
- Sold Price and Year Built are missing on the Sold/Closed floating card.
- Sold/Closed photos sometimes missing without placeholder.
- Sold/Closed floating card format should match CMA “Properties Used in Analysis” card style.
- Recent CMAs list needs sorting options.

Requirements:
1) Sold/Closed floating card must include:
   - Sold Price (must be correct from Repliers “closePrice” / sold price field)
   - Sold Date (already requested earlier)
   - Year Built (from Repliers)
   - Beds / Baths / Sq Ft (if available)
   - Status badge = Sold/Closed
   - Address + Subdivision + Neighborhood (separate fields if available)
2) Photo behavior:
   - If no photos, show placeholder text/box exactly like CMA: “No photos available”
   - Do not show broken image icon
3) Card formatting:
   - Copy the same layout/format used in CMA → “Properties Used in Analysis (N)”
   - Keep styling consistent (typography, spacing, stat chips)
4) Global consistency:
   - Ensure Sold Price displayed here matches Sold Price used in CMA + Properties + Buyer Search (same mapping field).
   - Add a shared helper for “displaySoldPrice()” sourced from Repliers fields to avoid mismatch.
5) Recent CMAs sorting:
   - Add sort dropdown/options on Dashboard “Recent CMAs”:
     • Newest → Oldest (default)
     • A–Z
     • Z–A
   - Sorting must reflect the same CMA list source as CMAs section.

Testing:
- Click multiple Sold/Closed items:
  - Sold price shows and matches Repliers
  - Year built shows
  - Placeholder appears if no photos
- Change Recent CMA sort modes and verify correct ordering.

====================================================
B) PROPERTIES — RESTORE FULL DATE RANGE PICKER (MONTH/DAY/YEAR FROM + TO)
====================================================

Problem:
- The Date Range was changed; user wants the prior version restored.

Requirements:
- Restore the prior Date Range control that allows selecting:
  - From: Month / Day / Year
  - To: Month / Day / Year
- Ensure user can change ALL parts (month, day, year) for both start and end.
- Preserve date range selection during navigation unless Reset is clicked.

Testing:
- Set From/To dates including different months/years.
- Run search and confirm results reflect the chosen range.

====================================================
C) CMA — PRINT PDF SHOULD NOT CAPTURE AGENT UI / MUST LOOK LIKE REPORT
====================================================

Problems:
- Print PDF is capturing UI-only content (ex: agent “save” behavior / UI state) and looks like a screenshot.
- PDF must resemble Share Link output style (clean report).

Requirements:
1) Print output must exclude ALL agent-only UI elements:
   - Save button/controls
   - Yellow toolbars/action rows
   - Sticky headers
   - Any edit/modify controls
   - Any UI state artifacts (like active selections, focus outlines)
2) PDF styling must be report-like:
   - Clean margins
   - Proper page breaks
   - No clipping / no scroll containers
3) Validate that the PDF contains only intended CMA report sections and not interactive UI.
4) Compare against Share Link output and align structure/format as closely as possible.

Testing:
- Generate CMA → Save (agent action) → Print PDF:
  - Confirm PDF does NOT include agent UI components or states
  - Confirm looks like a formatted report, not a webpage screenshot

====================================================
D) BUYER SEARCH — SUGGESTIVE INPUT (AUTOCOMPLETE) NOT SHOWING
====================================================

Problem:
- Suggestive input for Cities, Zip Codes, Subdivision, Elementary is not showing.

Requirements:
1) Implement autocomplete suggestions for:
   - Cities
   - Zip codes
   - Subdivision
   - Elementary (schools)
2) Behavior:
   - As user types, show suggestion list from Repliers-backed dataset.
   - User can click a suggestion to fill the field.
   - Must debounce input to avoid excessive API calls.
3) Ensure suggestions work even if user types partial strings (case-insensitive).
4) If no suggestions, show “No matches”.

Testing:
- Type 3–5 letters into each field and confirm suggestions appear.
- Click suggestion and confirm it populates the input.

====================================================
E) NAVIGATION — MOVE “EMBED CODE” INTO SETTINGS
====================================================

Requirement:
- Remove “Embed Code” from left navigation as a standalone item.
- Move Embed Code UI inside Settings section as a settings page/tab:
  - Settings → Embed Code
- Ensure routing still works and no broken links.

Testing:
- Left nav no longer shows “Embed Code”
- Settings contains “Embed Code” and opens properly.

====================================================
F) SETTINGS — ADD USEFUL SETTINGS (SUGGESTIONS + IMPLEMENT BASIC STRUCTURE)
====================================================

Implement a Settings structure with clear sections (even if some are placeholders):
Suggested Settings modules:
1) Profile
   - Name, email (display)
2) Data & Sync
   - Data source = Repliers
   - Last updated timestamp
   - Manual sync button (if supported)
3) Display Preferences
   - Default statuses (Active/UC/Sold) for searches
   - Default sort preferences
4) Notifications (optional placeholder)
   - Saved search alerts (future)
5) Embed Code (moved here)

Testing:
- Settings page renders with sections, no blank placeholders without labels.

====================================================
G) CLIENTS + ANALYTICS — PROVIDE FEATURE SUGGESTIONS (AND OPTIONAL “COMING SOON” STRUCTURE)
====================================================

Clients page suggestions (agent-focused):
- Client list with:
  • name, email/phone
  • saved searches
  • shared CMAs
  • notes
  • last activity
- Ability to “Send CMA” or “Share properties” to a client

Analytics page suggestions:
- Agent usage analytics:
  • CMAs created
  • properties viewed
  • saved searches created
- Market analytics:
  • avg/median sold price trends by area
  • DOM filters
  • absorption/inventory summary
- Export/download (future)

Implementation requirement:
- Replace the blank pages with a basic “Coming soon” layout that includes the above bullets so users understand future value.

====================================================
H) LEAD GATE — REVIEW PURPOSE + RECOMMENDATION
====================================================

Requirement:
- Investigate what “Lead Gate” is intended to do in this app.
- Provide a short recommendation:
  - Keep it (and explain use)
  - Rename it
  - Move it under Settings/Admin
  - Or remove if unused

Testing:
- Confirm Lead Gate route does not break navigation.

====================================================
FINAL REPORT REQUIRED
====================================================

Provide:
1) Dashboard Sold/Closed floating card before/after proof:
   - Sold price + year built added
   - Placeholder “No photos available”
   - CMA-style format applied
2) Recent CMAs sorting options proof.
3) Properties date range restored proof.
4) CMA PDF before/after proof showing:
   - No agent UI artifacts
   - Report-like formatting
5) Buyer Search autocomplete proof for 4 fields.
6) Nav change proof: Embed Code moved under Settings.
7) Settings structure + suggested features for Clients/Analytics + Lead Gate recommendation.
