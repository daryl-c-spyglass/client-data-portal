UPDATE / CLARIFICATION — PROPERTY LOCATION FIELDS

IMPORTANT:
Neighborhood and Subdivision are TWO SEPARATE fields and must NOT be combined.

====================================================
ACTIVE PROPERTY FLOATING CARD – LOCATION FIELDS UPDATE
====================================================

When displaying property details in the floating card (Dashboard):

You MUST show BOTH of the following as separate fields, if available from Repliers:

- Neighborhood  
  • Use the dedicated Neighborhood field from Repliers  
  • Example: “Neighborhood: Cherry Creek East”

- Subdivision  
  • Use the Subdivision / SubdivisionName field from Repliers  
  • Example: “Subdivision: Cherry Creek Ph 06 Sec 02”

Do NOT:
- Merge Neighborhood and Subdivision into one label
- Replace one with the other
- Fallback incorrectly unless one is truly missing

If one field is missing:
- Show the available one
- Do NOT duplicate values

====================================================
UPDATED REQUIRED FIELDS IN FLOATING CARD
====================================================

Ensure the floating card displays ALL of the following (Repliers-driven):

- Beds
- Baths
- Sq Ft
- Year Built
- Pool: Yes / No
- Garage: numeric value (example: “Garage: 2”)
- Elementary School
- Neighborhood (separate field)
- Subdivision (separate field)
- MLS # (Listing ID)

Layout:
- Group location-related fields logically
- Ensure no clipping or overflow
- Works for Active, Under Contract, and Sold/Closed properties

====================================================
TESTING REQUIRED
====================================================

1. Click an Active property on Dashboard:
   - Verify Neighborhood and Subdivision both appear separately.
2. Click an Under Contract property:
   - Same verification.
3. Click a Sold/Closed property (if shown on Dashboard):
   - Same verification.
4. Confirm no layout overlap or truncation.

====================================================
FINAL REPORT UPDATE
====================================================

In the final report, explicitly confirm:
- Which Repliers fields are mapped to “Neighborhood”
- Which Repliers fields are mapped to “Subdivision”
- Confirmation they are displayed separately in the floating card
