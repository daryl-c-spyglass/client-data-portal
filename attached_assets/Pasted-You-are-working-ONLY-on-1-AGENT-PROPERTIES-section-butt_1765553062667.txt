You are working ONLY on:
1) AGENT PROPERTIES section (button alignment + styling)
2) CMA RESULTS / CREATED CMA section (Listings map layout, Timeline, Market Stats layout + markers)
NOT IDX/public pages.

Data source: Repliers. Leasing/rentals excluded globally.
Implement changes one-by-one and test each.

====================================================
A) PROPERTIES SECTION — ALIGN + RESTYLE BUTTONS (SEND PROPERTIES / QUICK CMA)
====================================================

Current issue:
- “Send Properties” and “Quick CMA” buttons are floating and not aligned with Reset / Search Properties.
- Styling does not match Spyglass palette and needs consistency.

Requirements:
1) Layout alignment:
- Place buttons in the SAME row and aligned with:
  - Reset
  - Search Properties
- The order must be:
  [Reset]  [Search Properties]  [Send Properties]  [Quick CMA]
- All buttons must be vertically aligned and consistent height/padding.
- Remove floating placement for these actions (no bottom-right floating for this screen).

2) Styling:
- Search Properties button:
  - background: WHITE
  - border: Spyglass palette ORANGE outline
  - text: ORANGE
- Send Properties & Quick CMA buttons:
  - background: Spyglass palette ORANGE
  - text: WHITE
  - hover: slightly darker orange

3) Functionality:
- Ensure BOTH buttons are working end-to-end:
  - Send Properties → redirects to Seller Updates and pre-fills selected properties.
  - Quick CMA → redirects to CMA create flow and pre-fills comps.
- Buttons should be disabled if there are 0 selected properties, enabled otherwise.
- Add selection count in label:
  - “Send Properties (N)”
  - “Quick CMA (N)”

Testing (required):
- Select 3 properties → confirm Send Properties works and data is passed.
- Select 3 properties → confirm Quick CMA works and data is passed.
- Confirm visual alignment and colors match requirements.

====================================================
B) CREATED CMA — MOVE MAP INTO LISTINGS (SIDE-BY-SIDE)
====================================================

Goal:
- In CMA Results, put the Map inside the “Listings” section and display it side-by-side with the list.

Requirements:
1) In the Listings tab/section:
- Layout should be a 2-column view:
  - Left: List of properties (subject + comps)
  - Right: Map
- Make both panes scroll-friendly:
  - List scrolls independently
  - Map stays visible (sticky is OK)

2) Map markers:
- Replace dot markers with a HOUSE EMOJI marker (🏠).
- House emoji markers must be used across ALL maps in CMA (Listings map + Market Stats map, etc.).
- Add status color variation:
  - Active: green tint/outline
  - Under Contract: orange/yellow tint/outline
  - Sold/Closed: gray/red tint/outline
(Do not change the emoji itself; change the marker container/pin styling behind it.)

3) Map interactions:
- Clicking a marker opens the same floating property card used elsewhere.
- Fit bounds to show all properties by default.

Testing:
- Generate a CMA with 5+ comps → confirm side-by-side layout works and markers show as 🏠 with status styling.
- Click markers → floating card opens.

====================================================
C) TIMELINE — CHART & UI CLEANUP + BLOCK ORDER
====================================================

Requirements:
1) Price Timeline chart:
- Change the broken/dashed line to a STRAIGHT SOLID line.
- Ensure Median is NOT the same color as Average:
  - Average line color must differ from Median line color.
- Remove the label “Metric: Price (5 properties)”.
- Retain the statistics columns:
  - Range
  - Average
  - Median

2) Remove filter controls:
- Remove “Filter by Status” from Timeline.

3) Reorder blocks:
- Move “Market Insights” block ABOVE the “Price Timeline” block.

Testing:
- Open CMA Results → Timeline section:
  - Solid line is visible
  - Average and Median are visually distinct
  - Status filter removed
  - Market Insights appears above Price Timeline
  - Range/Average/Median remain visible

====================================================
D) MARKET STATS — INVENTORY DIAL + MAP SIDE-BY-SIDE (BELOW CMA MARKET REVIEW)
====================================================

Goal:
- Market Stats should show the Inventory Dial beside the Map and place them below CMA Market Review.

Requirements:
1) Layout:
- In Market Stats section:
  - Keep “CMA Market Review” at the top.
  - Directly BELOW it, add a 2-column layout:
    - Left: Inventory Dial widget
    - Right: Map
- Ensure spacing and sizing are balanced for a professional look.

2) Inventory Dial content:
- Show what is already used:
  - Absorption Rate: “X properties per month”
  - Inventory: “Y month(s)”
- Ensure values are derived from Repliers data and rental-excluded dataset.

3) Market Stats map markers:
- Use HOUSE EMOJI markers (🏠) instead of dots.
- Apply the same status color variations as Listings map.
- Apply house emoji markers consistently “across section for property location”.

Testing:
- Open Market Stats:
  - CMA Market Review visible
  - Inventory Dial and Map appear side-by-side below it
  - House emoji markers are used and color-coded by status
  - Clicking marker opens floating property card

====================================================
FINAL REQUIREMENTS
====================================================

1) Consistency:
- House emoji markers (🏠) must be used across CMA maps (Listings + Market Stats + any other CMA map).
- Status color variation must be consistent everywhere.

2) No regressions:
- Do not break existing carousel, floating cards, or selection flows.

====================================================
FINAL REPORT REQUIRED
====================================================

Provide:
- Screenshots showing:
  1) Properties button row alignment + new colors
  2) Listings side-by-side layout with 🏠 markers
  3) Timeline chart with solid line + distinct avg/median + removed controls
  4) Market Stats CMA Market Review + Inventory Dial beside Map with 🏠 markers
- Confirmation testing steps were performed and passed.
