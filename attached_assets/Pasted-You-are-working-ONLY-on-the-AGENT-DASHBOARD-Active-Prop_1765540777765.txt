ACTIVE PROPERTIES — AUTO-CAROUSEL CARD MOVEMENT
====================================================

Goal:
- The Active Properties cards should automatically slide like a carousel every 3 seconds,
  in addition to existing manual navigation.

Current behavior:
- Cards are static unless user clicks arrows or scrolls.

Required behavior:
1) Enable automatic carousel movement:
   - Cards auto-advance every 3 seconds.
   - Movement should be smooth (no jump / jitter).
   - Loop back to the first card after the last card.

2) Manual control must still work:
   - Left / Right arrow buttons remain functional.
   - Manual interaction should temporarily pause auto-rotation, then resume after inactivity.

3) Do NOT cap the number of properties:
   - All eligible Active properties (post-filtering) should be part of the carousel.

4) Maintain current card content:
   - Image
   - Price
   - Status badge
   - Beds / Baths / Sq Ft
   - Address
   - City / State
   - Clicking a card still opens the floating property modal.

5) Accessibility & UX:
   - Auto-carousel must pause on hover.
   - Keyboard navigation (arrow keys) should continue to work if already implemented.
   - Respect reduced-motion preferences if present.

====================================================
TESTING REQUIRED
====================================================

You MUST verify:
1) Carousel auto-moves every ~3 seconds.
2) Manual navigation still works and does not break auto-play.
3) Auto-play resumes after manual interaction.
4) Carousel loops correctly after the last property.
5) No layout shift, flicker, or content clipping occurs.
6) Floating card modal still opens correctly when clicking a property.

====================================================
FINAL REPORT REQUIRED
====================================================

Provide:
- Which component/file was updated for the Active Properties carousel.
- How auto-rotation timing is implemented (interval/animation).
- Confirmation no other dashboard sections were affected.
