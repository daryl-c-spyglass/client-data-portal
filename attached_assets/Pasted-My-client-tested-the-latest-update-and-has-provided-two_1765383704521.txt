My client tested the latest update and has provided two additional required fixes. Please implement the following:

==================================================
1) Add “Sold Date Range” Filter to CMA and Property Search
==================================================

Add a new field called **Sold Date** with a dropdown that allows users to filter sold listings by how recent the sale was.

Dropdown options:

• 0–30 days  
• 0–60 days  
• 0–90 days  
• 0–120 days  
• 0–150 days  
• 0–180 days  

Behavior requirements:

- This filter should be available where SOLD listings are queried:  
  • CMA Builder  
  • Property search (when status = Closed/Sold)

- The filter should limit results to listings whose `closeDate` falls within the selected day range relative to *today*.

- Make sure you use the correct Repliers field for close date (usually `closeDate` or equivalent).

==================================================
2) Fix the “Public Link” Feature
==================================================

When clicking **Public Link**, the system generates a URL, but when sharing or posting the link, it displays an empty or incorrect preview (see screenshot).  
This must be fixed.

Requirements:

- Ensure the public page renders correctly when accessed directly.  
- The preview metadata must be correct for external sharing (Open Graph / social preview).  
  Include:  
  • Title  
  • Description  
  • Thumbnail image  
  • Correct URL  

- The public link should display the CMA or property data properly, not an empty template.

==================================================
Summary of Required Tasks
==================================================

1. Add “Sold Date” dropdown with 6 preset ranges.  
2. Apply sold date filtering to CMA Builder and property search for Closed/Sold listings.  
3. Fix Public Link page so that:  
   • It loads correctly  
   • Shows the correct preview when shared  
   • Displays the proper CMA or property content

Make these updates without altering existing UI styles or layouts.
