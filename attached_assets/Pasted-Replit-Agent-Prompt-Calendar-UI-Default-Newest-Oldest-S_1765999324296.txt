Replit Agent Prompt — Calendar UI: Default Newest→Oldest + Sort Options + View Toggle (List vs Calendar Grid)

We need enhancements to the Calendar section UI.

Goals

Default sorting for Calendar items should be Newest → Oldest.

Add a Sort dropdown with options:

Newest → Oldest (default)

Oldest → Newest

A → Z (by title)

Z → A (by title)

Add a View toggle so the user can switch between:

List view (current list)

Calendar grid view similar to Google Calendar (Month / Week / Day options)

Requirements
A) Sorting behavior (applies to List view)

By default, when Calendar data loads, order items by date/time descending (newest first).

Sort dropdown must re-order the displayed items without re-fetching (client-side sorting is fine).

Sorting definitions:

Newest → Oldest: eventStart descending

Oldest → Newest: eventStart ascending

A → Z: normalize title (trim + lowercase) and sort ascending

Z → A: same, descending

If some items do not have a start time, place them at the bottom consistently.

B) Add Sort UI controls (like Google Calendar style)

Add a dropdown near existing filters (Agent, Month navigation, Today, Refresh).

Label it “Sort” with the options above.

Persist the selection in local storage so it stays consistent per user.

C) Add View Toggle (List vs Calendar Grid)

Add a control near the top right similar to Google Calendar:

View: Month / Week / Day + List

Default view: List (unless you think Calendar grid should be default—keep List as default for now).

Persist the last selected view in local storage.

D) Calendar Grid View implementation

Implement a basic calendar grid for:

Month view (required)

Week view (optional but preferred)

Day view (optional)

Use the same calendar items that already load from FUB.

Display items in the correct date cell by start date.

Clicking an item should open the existing event/task details panel (or a simple modal if none exists).

E) Data model assumptions

Calendar items should be normalized into a single list with fields like:

id

title

startAt (ISO)

endAt (ISO or null)

type (task/appointment/event)

agentId / assignedUserId (if applicable)

Sorting and rendering should use these normalized fields.

F) UX details

Keep the existing Filters section intact.

When switching views, keep the same selected month/day and agent filter.

Provide empty states:

“No items found for this period”

Provide loading skeletons for both views.

Deliverables

Provide exact file paths changed.

Confirm default sort is Newest → Oldest.

Confirm sort dropdown works.

Confirm view toggle works (List + Month grid at minimum).

Keep styling consistent with the current Mission Control UI.
