I have another set of focused fixes for the CMA / Properties experience. Please apply these changes without altering the overall UI design.

==================================================

Property Detail Overlay – Image Controls
==================================================

On Search Results, when I click on a property address, it opens the floating detail view with images and information.

Current issues with the image carousel:

There is a grey left-side overlay/area that looks like a disabled control.

The navigation UX is unclear.

Required behavior:

Remove the grey left overlay/area entirely.

Keep the automatic carousel (auto-advance every ~3 seconds).

Allow the user to:

Click on the left side of the image to move to the previous photo.

Click on the right side of the image to move to the next photo.

The entire image area should behave like a two-zone control (left = back, right = forward).

==================================================
2) Sold/Closed Search – Georgetown + Oaks at San Gabriel

In Search Properties, when filtering with:

City: Georgetown

Subdivision: Oaks at San Gabriel

Status: Sold/Closed

The result returns 0 properties, which appears incorrect.

Required:

Verify with Repliers whether Sold/Closed listings exist for this filter.

If yes, fix the search query / normalization so these properties appear correctly.

Ensure the subdivision filter is using the correct LIKE or matching logic for longer subdivision names.

==================================================
3) Print PDF vs Share CMA – Content Must Match

The Share CMA view displays correct and preferred formatting.

The Print / PDF output still does not match the Share CMA layout.

Required:

Make the PDF output exactly mirror the Share CMA design, including:

Formatting

Section structure

Data values

Ordering of content

Remove any old template discrepancies so both outputs use the same components/data mapping.

==================================================
4) Info Toggles – Home Average, Listings, Timeline, Market Stats

Tooltip issues still exist:

Tooltip text is cut off.

Long explanations are not readable.

Required:

Fix tooltip width, wrapping, and positioning so full text is readable, OR

Summarize tooltip content into shorter text that displays cleanly.

Ensure hover/tooltip behavior works across all four sections.

==================================================
5) Market Stats – No Output Despite Having Comparables

Market Stats continues to show no data, even when valid comps were selected.

Required:

Market Stats must display grouped statistics for:

Active

Under Contract

Closed/Sold

Use the exact comparable properties selected during CMA creation.

For each status group show counts, averages, price ranges, etc.

Ensure that status classification uses the correct Repliers status codes.

==================================================
6) Modify Search (Yellow Box) – Must Follow Current Updates

The Modify Search button in the yellow box should follow all the recent functional updates.

Required behavior:

When Modify Search is clicked:

It should return to the CMA search page with the same filters prefilled.

The previously selected Subject and Comparable properties should remain selected.

The workflow should now incorporate the updated behavior for:

Property type filters

Sold date filters

Correct autocomplete

Accurate search results

Updated card data

Updated carousel behavior

Modify Search must not reset data or misalign the new updated filter logic.

Please implement these updates while keeping the existing UI styling. Focus on data accuracy, carousel behavior improvements, unified PDF/Share layout, readable tooltips, complete Market Stats output, and ensuring Modify Search works correctly with all recent enhancements.
