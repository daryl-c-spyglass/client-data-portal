You are working ONLY on the CMA RESULT page of the app (NOT IDX or public search). All data and photos come from Repliers.

Fix the following items one by one:

====================================================
1) HOME AVERAGE – PROPERTY LIST AT BOTTOM
====================================================
Problem:
- In the CMA Result → Home Average section, the list of properties (with thumbnails + info + floating card behavior) is NOT showing. The properties should appear at the bottom of this section.

Requirements:
- In the Home Average section:
  - Keep the summary statistics at the top as they are now.
  - At the **bottom** of the Home Average card/section, render a list of the properties that are used to calculate the Home Average.
  - For each property in this list show:
    • Thumbnail image from Repliers (or “No photos available” text if there are no photos).
    • Address
    • Price (and $/sqft if available)
    • Beds, baths, sq ft, status
    • Key dates (List date, Sold date if applicable)
- Interaction:
  - Clicking any property in this Home Average list must open the SAME centered CMA floating card/modal (with carousel + full details) that is used elsewhere in CMA.

Testing:
- Generate a CMA with multiple comps.
- Confirm:
  - Home Average shows stats at the top.
  - A property list appears at the bottom with thumbnails/info.
  - Clicking an item opens the standard CMA floating card.

====================================================
2) LISTINGS SECTION – MOVE PROPERTY LIST TO BOTTOM
====================================================
Problem:
- In the CMA Result → Listings section, properties are not positioned at the bottom.

Requirements:
- In the Listings section:
  - Ensure the Listings summary (counts/metrics) is shown at the top.
  - Render the list of properties at the **bottom** of this section.
  - Each property row must display:
    • Thumbnail image from Repliers (or “No photos available” text if no photos).
    • Address
    • Price, beds, baths, sq ft, status, dates.
  - Sort the properties from **low price to high price**.
  - Clicking any property opens the SAME centered CMA floating card/modal.

Testing:
- Generate a CMA with multiple listing records.
- Confirm:
  - Listing summary is at top.
  - Property list is at bottom.
  - Properties are ordered low → high price.
  - Floating card opens correctly on click.

====================================================
3) TIMELINE SECTION – ENHANCE FOR CMA ANALYSIS
====================================================
Problem:
- In CMA Result → Timeline section (with description “Visual chart showing property prices over time with status indicators to identify market trends.”), the bottom of the card looks plain and not very useful.

Requirements:
- Keep the existing price-over-time chart but make the Timeline more useful for CMA analysis for Texas real estate agents.

Implement the following:

A) Rich tooltips:
   - For each point on the chart, tooltip must display:
     • Status (Active / Under Contract / Sold/Closed)
     • List Price and (if Sold) Sold Price
     • Relevant date (List date, Sold date, or Under Contract date depending on status)
     • Days metric:
       - Sold/Closed: “Days on Market: X” where X = SoldDate – ListDate (from Repliers).
       - Active: “Days Active: X” where X = Today – ListDate.
       - Under Contract: “Days Under Contract: X” where X = Today – UnderContractDate (or equivalent field from Repliers).

B) Status filters:
   - Add checkboxes or toggle chips beneath the chart for:
     • Active
     • Under Contract
     • Sold/Closed
   - Toggling these must filter which points/lines are shown on the chart.

C) Summary insights bar (under the chart):
   - Add a concise insights row showing metrics useful to Texas agents, calculated from the comps:
     • Median Sold Price
     • Average Days on Market (Sold/Closed)
     • Average List-to-Sale Price Ratio (%) for Sold/Closed
   - These values must update based on the current set of comps used in the CMA.

D) Subject property highlight:
   - If a Subject Property is defined and has a price/time point:
     • Render it with a distinct marker (e.g., different shape or size).
     • Label it as “Subject Property” on hover.

Testing:
- With a CMA containing Active, UC, and Sold comps:
  - Verify tooltips show all required info.
  - Toggling status filters changes the chart.
  - Summary insights bar displays correct values.
  - Subject property point is highlighted when applicable.

====================================================
4) PRINT PDF – ALLOW MULTIPLE PAGES, INCLUDE MARKET STATS (NO IMAGES)
====================================================
Problem:
- PDF print may be restricted to a single page and/or missing Market Stats.

Requirements:
- Adjust the CMA Print → PDF so that:
  - The PDF can span 2 or more pages as needed.
  - The PDF **must include**:
    • Market Stats section.
    • CMA Market Review text from Market Stats.
  - The PDF **must NOT include any property images**:
    • No thumbnails or carousel photos.
    • Only textual and numeric data for properties.

Testing:
- Generate a CMA with enough content to require 2+ pages.
- Print to PDF:
  - Confirm Market Stats and CMA Market Review are present.
  - Confirm there are no property images anywhere in the PDF.

====================================================
5) SHARE CMA LINK OUTPUT – INCLUDE CMA MARKET REVIEW
====================================================
Problem:
- The Share CMA link output is not including the CMA Market Review from the Market Stats section.

Requirements:
- When a user opens the shared CMA link (public CMA page):
  - Include the Market Stats section.
  - Include the CMA Market Review text in the same logical position as in the internal CMA view (typically at the bottom of Market Stats).

Testing:
- Generate a CMA, click Share, open the share link:
  - Confirm CMA Market Review text is visible and matches the internal CMA content.

====================================================
6) SOCIAL SHARE – INSTAGRAM & TIKTOK BEHAVIOR
====================================================
Problem:
- Share CMA → Instagram and TikTok buttons are still not directing users properly to those platforms’ landing/share pages. A “Link copied” heads-up is shown.

Requirements:
- For **Facebook** and **X**:
  - Keep the existing behavior (proper share URL with CMA link).

- For **Instagram** and **TikTok**:
  - Update the behavior so that when the user clicks:
    • It opens a relevant Instagram/TikTok URL suitable as a landing/share entry point in a new tab/window, and
    • It passes or makes available the CMA link in the best way supported by those platforms (e.g., as part of the URL query or prepared text).
  - The observable behavior to the user should be similar in intent to Facebook/X: clicking the button should clearly take them into Instagram/TikTok to share the CMA.

- Remove the heads-up text:
  - Delete the message:  
    “Instagram and TikTok: Link copied to clipboard. Paste in your bio or story.”

- You may still copy the link to clipboard silently as a convenience, but do not show that banner.

Testing:
- Click all social icons on the CMA Result page:
  • Facebook: opens FB share dialog with CMA link.
  • X: opens X share dialog with CMA link.
  • Instagram: opens a meaningful Instagram web/app page for sharing, with the CMA link available.
  • TikTok: opens a meaningful TikTok web/app page for sharing, with the CMA link available.
  • No “Link copied…” banner appears for Instagram or TikTok.
