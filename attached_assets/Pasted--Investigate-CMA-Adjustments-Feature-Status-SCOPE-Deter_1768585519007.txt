 Investigate CMA Adjustments Feature Status
SCOPE
Determine whether the CMA Adjustments feature exists in the codebase, is partially implemented, or needs to be built from scratch.

INVESTIGATION TASKS
Task 1: Search codebase for "adjustments" references
bash# Search for adjustment-related code
grep -ri "adjustment" --include="*.ts" --include="*.tsx" client/src/
grep -ri "adjustment" --include="*.ts" server/

# Check database schema
grep -ri "adjustment" shared/schema.ts
```

**Task 2: Check CMA data model**
```
- File: shared/schema.ts
- Look for: cmas table definition
- Question: Is there an "adjustments" field/column?
- If yes: What is the data type and structure?
```

**Task 3: Check CMA UI components**
```
- Search: client/src/components/CMA/
- Search: client/src/pages/ (CMA-related pages)
- Question: Is there an Adjustments tab, section, or form?
- Question: Is there any UI for entering adjustment values?
```

**Task 4: Check Presentation Preview component**
```
- File: CMAPresentationBuilder.tsx or PresentationPreview.tsx
- Find: Where "Adjustments" section renders
- Question: What data does it expect?
- Question: Is it just a placeholder or does it have real rendering logic?
```

**Task 5: Check API routes**
```
- File: server/routes/cma.ts (or similar)
- Question: Are there any endpoints for adjustments?
- Question: Is adjustments data included in CMA fetch responses?
```
