You MUST fix the image carousel behavior inside the floating property card/modal.

There are TWO critical issues:
1) A grey rectangle/overlay is still visible on the image.
2) Clicking on the left/right side of the image does NOT navigate backward/forward.

This task is HIGH PRIORITY and MUST be fully resolved.

====================================================
A. GREY OVERLAY / GREY RECTANGLE ON IMAGE
====================================================

1. Find the exact DOM element(s) causing the grey area:
   - Inspect all children inside the image/carousel container, including:
     • Arrow wrappers
     • Pagination container
     • Placeholder/mask divs
     • Default slider overlays from the carousel library
     • Any absolutely positioned backgrounds

2. Remove or restyle the offending element(s):
   - No visible grey block or panel may remain on top of the image.
   - The image region should only contain:
     • The actual photo
     • The centered slide counter (e.g. "8 / 25")
     • Back/forward arrows or icons
   - No other background (especially grey) should be visible within the image area.

3. Check for CSS that may be causing this:
   - Look for any rules with:
     • `background: gray` / `background-color: #ccc` / similar
     • Fixed height/width overlays
     • Absolute positioning within the image container
   - Remove or override these so they are not visible.

4. This fix MUST apply to ALL statuses:
   - Active
   - Under Contract
   - Sold/Closed

====================================================
B. CLICKABLE LEFT/RIGHT IMAGE ZONES — MUST WORK
====================================================

The required behavior is:

- Clicking on the LEFT half of the image:
  → Goes to the PREVIOUS photo (backward).

- Clicking on the RIGHT half of the image:
  → Goes to the NEXT photo (forward).

This is currently NOT working.

1. Implement click zones:
   - Either:
     • Add two transparent overlays (left/right) on top of the image, OR
     • Use the click position (e.clientX vs image midpoint) to decide direction.
   - These zones must:
     • Cover the full height of the image.
     • Cover half the width (left and right halves).
     • Not show any visible grey or colored blocks.

2. Wire the zones to the carousel:
   - Left zone click → call the carousel’s "previous" function.
   - Right zone click → call the carousel’s "next" function.
   - Ensure these work in addition to any explicit arrow buttons you already have.

3. Keep autoplay behavior:
   - The carousel must continue to auto-advance every ~3 seconds.
   - When the user clicks left/right:
     • Immediately move to the requested slide.
     • Pause autoplay briefly, then resume after a short delay (around 3 seconds).

====================================================
C. TESTING — REQUIRED STEPS
====================================================

You MUST test all of the following:

1. Open an **Active** listing floating card:
   - No grey overlay anywhere on the image.
   - Clicking left half moves backward.
   - Clicking right half moves forward.
   - Autoplay still works and resumes after clicking.

2. Open an **Under Contract** listing floating card:
   - Same tests as above — no grey overlay, left/right clicks work, autoplay OK.

3. Open a **Sold/Closed** listing floating card:
   - Same tests as above — no grey overlay, left/right clicks work, autoplay OK.

4. Test on both:
   - Desktop viewport
   - At least one smaller/mobile-width viewport

====================================================
D. REQUIRED REPORT
====================================================

After fixing, provide a short but precise report with:

1. The exact DOM element(s) that caused the grey block:
   - Component name and class/id.

2. The exact CSS/JS changes you made:
   - Files and selectors/functions updated.

3. How you implemented left/right click zones:
   - Whether you used overlays or click-position logic.

4. Confirmation that you tested:
   - Active, Under Contract, and Sold/Closed listings.
   - Desktop + small/mobile viewport.
   - Results: NO grey overlay, left/right click navigation works, autoplay works.

Partial fixes are NOT acceptable. Both the grey overlay AND left/right click behavior must be fully working.
