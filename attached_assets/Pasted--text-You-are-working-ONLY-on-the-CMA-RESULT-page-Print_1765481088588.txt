You are working ONLY on the CMA RESULT page → Print to PDF feature (NOT IDX or public pages).

Goal:
Fix the CMA Print to PDF output so that it ALWAYS includes the entire **CMA Market Review** from the Market Stats section, even if it requires adding extra pages to the PDF.

Scope:
- CMA Result page
- Market Stats section
- CMA Market Review content
- Print → PDF output

Do NOT modify:
- IDX print
- Any non-CMA PDFs
- MLS Grid or Repliers replication logic

TASK: CMA Market Review in Print PDF
========================================

Problem:
- The current CMA Print to PDF output either omits or truncates the CMA Market Review from the Market Stats section.

Requirements:

1. Include the full CMA Market Review in the PDF
   - Locate the **exact same CMA Market Review content** that appears under the Market Stats section in the CMA Result UI.
   - Ensure this entire text block is rendered in the PDF:
     • No truncation
     • No partial output
     • Preserve paragraphs / line breaks reasonably.

2. Positioning in the PDF
   - Place the CMA Market Review in the PDF in a logical position consistent with the UI, typically:
     • After the main Market Stats numbers/graphs section.
   - You may reference how the **Share CMA link output** structures Market Stats + Market Review and mirror that structure in the PDF.

3. Allow multiple pages
   - If including the full CMA Market Review causes the PDF to overflow:
     • Allow the PDF to span multiple pages (2+ pages is acceptable).
     • DO NOT cut off or remove the Market Review to force a single page.
   - Make sure the layout is clean when the content flows onto page 2 or beyond.

4. No property images
   - Maintain the existing rule that **property images must not appear in the PDF**:
     • No thumbnails
     • No carousel photos
   - Only include textual and numeric data plus the Market Review text.

5. Data source
   - The CMA Market Review content in the PDF must come from the **same source** and logic as:
     • The Market Stats → CMA Market Review section in the CMA Result UI.
     • The Share CMA link output (if it already includes Market Review).
   - There must be no divergence between what users see on-screen, what appears in the Share view, and what is printed.

========================================
Testing (you MUST perform these)
========================================

1. Generate a CMA with a non-trivial CMA Market Review (multiple sentences/paragraphs).
2. Print to PDF:
   - Confirm:
     • Market Stats show as expected.
     • The entire CMA Market Review text is present and readable (no truncation).
     • If content requires more than one page, the PDF contains multiple pages and all content is intact.
     • No property images appear in the PDF.

3. Open the Share CMA link for the same CMA:
   - Confirm the CMA Market Review text matches the text in the PDF.

========================================
Report
========================================

In your final notes, specify:
- Which components/templates were updated for the PDF.
- How/where the CMA Market Review content is pulled from.
- How many pages the sample CMA PDF used in testing, and confirmation that all Market Review text was included.
