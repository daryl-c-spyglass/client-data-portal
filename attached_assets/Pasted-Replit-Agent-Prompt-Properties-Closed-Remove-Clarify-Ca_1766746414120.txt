Replit Agent Prompt — Properties (Closed): Remove/Clarify Cart Icon + Fix “Save Search” Failure

We have two issues in the Properties section when viewing Closed results:

Property cards show a checkbox icon and a cart icon. It’s unclear if the cart icon is necessary/used. If it has no functional purpose, remove it to avoid user confusion.

Save Search flow is broken. When trying to save a search, the modal appears, but saving fails with: “Failed to save search. Please try again.”

Use this exact URL to reproduce:

Screenshot is provided for reference.

1) Cart Icon on Property Cards (Closed listings)
A) Determine if cart icon is used

Identify what the cart icon is intended to do:

Does it add to CMA?

Add to a client list?

Add to a “cart” or saved list?

Or is it unused/placeholder?

B) Implement the correct outcome (strict)

If cart icon has NO working function or no user-visible destination:

Remove the cart icon from property cards (Closed view and ideally across all statuses for consistency)

Keep only the checkbox/select behavior if that’s the intended selection mechanism

If cart icon DOES have a real function:

Make it explicit with:

Tooltip on hover: “Add to ___”

Click action that navigates or confirms where it goes

Ensure it is not redundant with the checkbox selection

Acceptance

There is no confusing cart icon with no purpose.

Either removed or clearly functional + explained.

2) Fix “Save Search” Failure (Critical Bug)
A) Reproduce and trace

Click Select / checkbox on properties, then trigger Save Search modal.

Attempt to save and capture:

network request URL

payload

response status and body

Identify if failure is caused by:

missing auth/session

missing required fields (name/userId/filters)

backend route not implemented

DB insert error

API key/env var missing

validation rejecting filters

B) Implement a working Save Search backend (if missing/broken)

Ensure there is a server endpoint like:

POST /api/saved-searches

Required payload to store:

{
  "name": "Austin - Test - Daryl",
  "filters": {
    "statuses": ["Closed"],
    "cities": ["Austin"],
    "propertySubType": "single-family",
    "...any other filters in the URL/UI..."
  },
  "source": "properties"
}


Persist to database with:

id

name

filters (JSON)

createdAt

createdBy (if auth exists; if not, store as null and still allow saving)

C) Fix client-side handling

On success:

close modal

toast: “Search saved”

On failure:

show the real reason (dev mode: include error detail; prod: user-friendly message)

Prevent double-submit (disable Save button while saving)

3) Ensure Saved Searches are discoverable

If the app already has “Saved Searches” somewhere:

confirm the saved search appears in that list
If not:

add a basic Saved Searches page OR add a dropdown under Save Search button showing saved items

4) Acceptance Tests (Must Pass)

✅ Using the sample URL, saving a search succeeds and shows confirmation
✅ Saved search is visible somewhere after saving
✅ Cart icon is either removed (if unused) OR clearly functional with tooltip + destination
✅ No console errors; network calls return 200 on save

Deliverables

File paths changed

Explanation of cart icon purpose (or confirmation removed)
