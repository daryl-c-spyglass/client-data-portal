I have some additional fixes and enhancements for the CMA Builder and report views. Please treat these as add-ons to my previous prompts, not a replacement.

=====================================

Search Properties – Barton Hills & Images
=====================================

a) Barton Hills subdivision not showing

In Search Properties, when I type or search for “Barton Hills” in the Subdivision field, it does not appear.

Please:

Make sure Barton Hills is returned in the subdivision autocomplete.

Verify the subdivision query is correctly mapped to Repliers data.

Confirm that searching with:

City: Austin

Subdivision: Barton Hills
returns the correct properties from Repliers.

b) Thumbnails + full photo carousel on Search Results

In Search Results, the property cards still do not show the exact listing image/thumbnail.

Required behavior:

Pull the first photo from Repliers’ photos/media array and display it as the card thumbnail.

When I click a card:

Open a photo viewer (overlay or in the floating property panel) that:

Shows all available images for that property.

Automatically cycles through the photos like a carousel:

Autoplay every 3 seconds.

Has left/right arrows so the user can manually navigate forward/backward.

The viewer should keep showing all information (address, beds, baths, price, etc.) while the images change.

=====================================
2) Data Accuracy for Status (Active / Under Contract / Sold)

I suspect that the data source or filters for Active, Under Contract, and Sold/Closed are not accurate.

Please:

Verify that each status filter maps exactly to Repliers’ status codes.

Confirm the counts and results for each status against Repliers directly.

Fix any query or normalization issues so the app’s results match Repliers as closely as possible.

=====================================
3) Property Detail / Toggle Panel – Text Cut Off

When I toggle/open the property information panel (detail view / floating card), the text and details are cut off and not fully visible.

Fix so that:

All key fields (address, remarks, features, etc.) are fully visible.

If content is long, the panel should be scrollable or expand correctly so no text is clipped.

=====================================
4) Print & Share – Layout and Behavior

a) Move Print next to Share

In the CMA report view, move the Print (PDF) icon so it appears beside the Share button in the upper right.

The Print button should still generate the same PDF output as before, just relocated.

b) Clean up PDF output icons

In the PDF output, remove:

The chain/link icon.

The share icon.

Those controls should exist only in the web app, not in the exported PDF.

c) Share link should show full report, not blank page

When I click Share, copy the share link, and open it in a new tab, it currently shows a blank page.

Fix so that:

The share link opens a full report view, equivalent to what we see in:

The on-screen preview, and

The PDF result.

The shared page should show the same content as the PDF (Home Averages, Listings, Timeline, Market Stats) in a client-friendly web layout.

=====================================
5) Market Stats – Status Breakdown Details

In Market Stats → Property Status Breakdown:

For each status (Active, Under Contract, Closed/Sold), the breakdown is missing detailed property information.

Required behavior:

For the chosen comparables and filter set, show:

The exact property addresses included in each status group.

Key information:

Price

Beds / baths

Living area (sqft)

DOM

A property picture/thumbnail for each listing.

The property type (Single Family, Condo, Townhouse, Multi-Family, Land).

This should apply to all statuses (Active, Under Contract, Closed/Sold), and be consistent with the properties actually used in the CMA.

Please apply these changes while keeping the existing UI styling and layout. Focus on fixing the data mapping to Repliers, making the photo behavior richer (thumbnails + carousel), and ensuring Share/Print/Market Stats all reflect the same accurate CMA data.
