Replit Agent Prompt — Calendar UI Fixes: View Dropdown Overlap + Month Overflow Popover + Refresh Animation

We have new Calendar UI feedback to implement.

1) Fix: View options overlap each other

Issue: The View dropdown/options are visually overlapping.

Requirements

Locate the View selector/dropdown component (List/Month/Week/Day).

Fix layout so options never overlap:

Use a proper dropdown/popover component (Radix/shadcn DropdownMenu or Select) with correct z-index.

Ensure menu renders in a portal layer if needed.

Add spacing/padding so items are fully readable and clickable.

Confirm it works on common widths and doesn’t overlap the calendar header controls.

2) Month view: if appointments > 3, show a floating card with ALL appointments + details (no “+4/+5”)

Current behavior: Shows first 3, then “+N more”.

New behavior

Still show first 3 items in the day cell.

If there are more than 3:

Replace the “+N more” text with a clickable chip/button like “View all (7)”.

Clicking opens a floating card/popover anchored to that day cell (NOT a separate page).

The floating card lists all appointments for that date with details.

Floating card requirements

Should be a popover/modal style (prefer Popover anchored to the cell, or Dialog on mobile).

Show:

Date header (e.g., “Dec 18, 2025”)

For each item:

Title

Type (task/appointment/event)

Start time → end time (if available)

Assigned agent (if available)

Related contact (if available)

Scrollable if many items.

Close behavior:

click outside closes

ESC closes

close icon (×)

Important: Do not display “+4/+5 etc.” anymore—use the floating card approach.

3) Refresh button: interactive animation + success state

Current behavior: Static refresh button.

New behavior

When user clicks Refresh:

Disable the button while refresh is in progress

Rotate the refresh icon (spinner-like rotation)

When refresh completes successfully:

button turns green briefly (e.g., 800–1200ms) to indicate success

then returns to the original color

If refresh fails:

show error state (keep existing error UI)

button can turn red briefly or just stop rotating and re-enable

Implementation details

Add UI states:

isRefreshing (true while fetching)

refreshSuccess (true briefly on success)

Rotation:

CSS animation on icon while isRefreshing

Color change:

apply a “success” class when refreshSuccess

Ensure this works in both List view and Month/Week/Day views.

Deliverables

Provide exact file paths changed.

Confirm:

View dropdown no longer overlaps and is usable.

Month view overflow opens a floating card showing all items + details.
