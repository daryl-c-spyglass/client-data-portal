You are working ONLY on the AGENT PROPERTIES module (Property Section).
Do NOT modify CMA pages or Buyer Search in this task.

Data source: Repliers only.
Total counts and inventory breakdowns must always stay in sync across sections.

NOTE: User will provide a sample Quick CMA PDF (“Quick CMA 2740.pdf”) for cross-checking workflow and Repliers data. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

====================================================
1) PROPERTIES — DATE RANGE MUST BE FULLY ADJUSTABLE (ANY MONTH/DAY/YEAR)
====================================================

Problem:
- Date range currently only works for certain months.
- User needs full flexibility to choose ANY Month/Day/Year for both From and To.

Requirements:
1) Replace/fix the Date Range control so the user can select:
   - From: Month / Day / Year (any valid date)
   - To: Month / Day / Year (any valid date)
2) Ensure no “month-limited” logic exists:
   - No restrictions tied to the current month or preloaded month window
   - No disabled months/years unless truly invalid
3) Validation rules:
   - From must be <= To
   - If invalid selection occurs, show clear inline error and do not run query
4) Query behavior:
   - The selected From/To date must be passed correctly to the backend request and then to Repliers.
   - Ensure correct field mapping depending on status:
     - Sold/Closed: filter by CloseDate (sold date)
     - Active/Under Contract: filter by ListDate or StatusChangeDate (choose one consistently and document it)

Testing:
- Set From = 01/01/2023 and To = 12/31/2025 and run search.
- Test random ranges across years/months (e.g., 03/15/2024 → 07/02/2024).
- Confirm results load and date filter is applied correctly.

====================================================
2) PROPERTIES — TOTAL PROPERTIES (376,965) MUST MATCH “PROPERTY INVENTORY BY TYPE”
====================================================

Problem:
- The “Total properties: 376,965” does not match the sum/breakdown shown in “Property Inventory by type”.
- This creates data trust issues and is inconsistent across sections.

Requirements:
1) Single source of truth:
   - Implement/ensure ONE backend method/endpoint provides:
     - totalProperties
     - countsByStatus
     - countsByType/Subtype
     - dataSourceName (Repliers)
     - lastUpdatedAt
   - Both “Total properties” and “Property Inventory by type” must be derived from the SAME payload.

2) Math consistency:
   - totalProperties must equal:
     - sum(countsByType/Subtype) for the same scope
     AND/OR
     - sum(countsByStatus) for the same scope
   - If there is an “Other/Unknown” bucket, it must be included in the sum.

3) Scope consistency (critical):
   - Ensure both totals are computed using the exact same filters:
     - same statuses included (Active + Under Contract + Sold/Closed OR whatever is selected)
     - same property subtype universe
     - rental/leasing excluded consistently
     - same geography scope (global inventory vs filtered inventory must be clearly labeled)
4) UI:
   - If totals represent “global inventory” while inventory by type represents “filtered inventory”, then:
     - clearly label them differently (but preferred is to keep both in the same scope so they match).
   - Otherwise, make them strictly synced.

Testing:
- Load Properties page and verify:
  - Total properties value matches the sum of “Property Inventory by type” chips.
  - Refresh the page and confirm still matches.
  - Cross-check with Dashboard/other sections if they use the same inventory endpoint (if already implemented).

====================================================
3) QUICK CMA PDF CROSS-CHECK (FOR WORKFLOW + REPLIERS DATA)
====================================================

When user supplies “Quick CMA 2740.pdf”, use it to validate that our Repliers-backed workflow aligns with:
- Active listings list prices and key fields (address, subdivision, year built, sqft, DOM) :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}
- Active Under Contract pricing + DOM/CDOM fields :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}
- Closed listings close price and close dates :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}

Requirement:
- Add a small internal debug tool/log option (dev-only) to compare:
  - Repliers fields used for list price/close price/close date/DOM
  - vs the values shown in the PDF rows, for a few sample properties.

====================================================
FINAL REPORT REQUIRED
====================================================

Provide:
1) Proof Date Range accepts any Month/Day/Year and works across multiple years.
2) Proof Total properties matches Property Inventory by type (include sums).
3) Summary of what was causing the mismatch and how it was fixed.
4) Notes from Quick CMA 2740 PDF cross-check (at least 3 properties verified). :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}
