You are working ONLY on:
1) AGENT PROPERTIES section (button removal)
2) CMA RESULTS section (Listings, Map sync, layout)
3) MARKET STATS section (remove specific block)
4) PRINT PDF rendering/layout (make it document-like, not screenshot-like)
NOT IDX/public pages.

Data source: Repliers. Leasing/rentals excluded globally.
Implement changes one-by-one and test each.

====================================================
A) PROPERTIES SECTION — REMOVE BUTTONS
====================================================

Requirement:
- Remove the “Send Properties” button.
- Remove the “Quick CMA” button.
- Ensure layout spacing remains clean (no empty gaps or misalignment).

Testing:
- Load Properties page and confirm both buttons are gone and UI looks clean.

====================================================
B) CMA RESULTS — “LISTINGS” ONLY (NO “LISTINGS & MAP” TAB TITLE)
====================================================

Requirement:
- In CMA Results navigation, remove/rename “Listings & Map”.
- Keep only a single tab/section named: “Listings”.
- Inside “Listings”, still show:
  - Listings list
  - Property Location map (embedded in the Listings page)
But DO NOT label the tab as “Listings & Map”.

Testing:
- Open CMA Results and confirm tab label is “Listings” only.

====================================================
C) LISTINGS FILTER MUST SYNC WITH PROPERTY LOCATION MAP
====================================================

Problem:
- Filter pills/tabs: All, Sold, Under Contract, Active.
Map must reflect the same filtered subset.

Requirements:
1) When user changes the filter:
   - All (N) → map shows all N properties
   - Sold (N) → map shows only sold properties
   - Under Contract (N) → map shows only UC properties
   - Active (N) → map shows only active properties
2) This must sync in real-time with NO stale markers.
3) Counts (N) must reflect the same filtered dataset.
4) Map should refit bounds to the filtered markers automatically.

Testing:
- Use a CMA with mixed statuses:
  - Click All → confirm all markers show
  - Click Sold → confirm only sold markers show
  - Click Under Contract → confirm only UC markers show
  - Click Active → confirm only active markers show

====================================================
D) PROPERTY LOCATION MARKERS — MATCH MARKET STATS EMOJI COLORS
====================================================

Requirement:
- On Listings → Property Location map:
  - Copy the SAME emoji marker styling/colors already used in Market Stats.
  - Use the same house emoji + the same color variation per status.
- Ensure consistency between:
  - Listings Property Location map
  - Market Stats map markers (existing behavior)

Testing:
- Compare Listings map vs Market Stats map:
  - Status colors match exactly.

====================================================
E) MOVE “PRICE DISTRIBUTION” BELOW “PROPERTY LOCATION”
====================================================

Requirement:
- In the Listings section, reorder the blocks so:
  1) Listings list + Property Location map (top)
  2) Price Distribution (below Property Location)

Testing:
- Open Listings section and confirm Price Distribution appears below map.

====================================================
F) MARKET STATS — REMOVE “PROPERTY LOCATIONS OVERVIEW” BELOW PRICE TREND ANALYSIS
====================================================

Requirement:
- In Market Stats section:
  - Remove the “Property Locations Overview” block that appears below “Price Trend Analysis”.
- Do NOT remove any other Market Stats features.

Testing:
- Open Market Stats and confirm that block is removed and layout remains clean.

====================================================
G) PRINT PDF — FIX CUT-OFF + REMOVE GREY LINE + MAKE IT DOCUMENT-LIKE
====================================================

Problems:
- PDF content is cut off.
- A grey vertical line appears on the right (looks like a cursor/scrollbar).
- PDF looks like a screenshot instead of a document.

Requirements:
1) Fix PDF layout so it renders like a proper document:
   - Use print CSS (page size, margins, font rendering).
   - Avoid screenshot-style capture artifacts.
   - Ensure consistent spacing and readable typography.
2) Remove any scrollbars/cursor lines from the PDF output:
   - Ensure overflow/scroll containers do not render scrollbars.
   - Remove any “fake cursor” or right-side overlay in print mode.
3) Fix cut-off:
   - Ensure all sections flow across pages naturally.
   - Add page breaks where needed.
   - No clipped panels, no hidden content.
4) Validate the PDF output on:
   - Chrome print
   - any server-side PDF generator used (if applicable)

Testing:
- Generate PDF for a CMA with multiple sections.
- Confirm:
  - No cut-off content
  - No grey right-side line
  - Looks like a formatted document (not a screenshot)
  - Multi-page layout works correctly

====================================================
FINAL REPORT REQUIRED
====================================================

Provide screenshots/proof for:
1) Properties page without Send Properties / Quick CMA buttons
2) CMA Results “Listings” only tab label
3) Filter syncing with map markers (All vs Sold vs UC vs Active)
4) Property Location marker colors matching Market Stats
5) Price Distribution moved below Property Location
6) Market Stats: Property Locations Overview removed
7) PDF before/after showing:
   - grey line removed
   - no cut-off
   - document-like formatting
