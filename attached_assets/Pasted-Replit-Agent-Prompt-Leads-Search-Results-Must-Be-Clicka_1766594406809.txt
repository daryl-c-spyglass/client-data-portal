Replit Agent Prompt — Leads Search Results Must Be Clickable (Open Lead Details + Populate Agent Insights)

In the Leads section, search is returning results (example: “Adrian Lennar South”), but clicking the lead name does nothing. This is a UX bug — users expect the lead row/card to open details or at minimum trigger a selection state that loads the insights panel.

We need to make each lead row clickable and functional.

1) Make Lead Cards Clickable (Primary Fix)
Requirements

The entire lead row/card (or at least the lead name) must be clickable.

On click, it must do ONE of the following (choose best based on app architecture):

Option A (Preferred): Navigate to Lead Details page

Route: /leads/:leadId

Show:

name, email, phone

tags

assigned agent

created date

recent activity (timeline)

Provide a Back button to Leads list.

Option B: Open a side panel (drawer)

Clicking a lead opens a right-side drawer with the same details.

Drawer can be closed without losing the list state.

Option C: Expand inline

Clicking expands the card to show details + activity.

Must be consistent across list and search results.

2) Ensure Lead Click Also Updates “Agent Insights” Correctly
Requirement

When a lead is clicked:

If that lead has an assigned agent:

the Agent Insights panel should populate for that agent

show birthday / home anniversary / recent activity

If assigned agent is unknown:

show “No assigned agent found for this lead”

3) Add Visual UX Feedback (Selection State)
Requirements

When a lead is clicked:

highlight the selected lead row

show cursor pointer on hover

Add aria accessibility:

lead row should be keyboard accessible (Enter to open)

4) Fix likely cause: click handler missing / blocked
Requirements

Inspect current lead card component and confirm:

it has onClick wired

it is not blocked by an overlay / disabled div

it is not inside an element preventing pointer events

If currently using buttons/links inside the row:

ensure event bubbling does not prevent the card click

5) Acceptance Tests (Must Pass)

✅ Search “Adrian Lennar South” → results show
✅ Clicking the lead name OR card opens lead details (route/drawer/expand)
✅ Agent Insights updates based on the clicked lead’s assigned agent
✅ Selected lead is visually highlighted
✅ Works for All agents and single-agent filter modes
