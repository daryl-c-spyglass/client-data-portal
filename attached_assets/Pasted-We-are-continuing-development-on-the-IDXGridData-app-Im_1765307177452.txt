We are continuing development on the IDXGridData app.

Important data source preference from the client:
- For this project, we want to use Repliers as the primary data source.
- BO and IDX are for MLS Grid in general, but for this app Repliers has more functionality, so we want to keep testing it while we have free access.
- MLS Grid and the local PostgreSQL database can still be used as a fallback or for long-term historical data, but Repliers should be preferred wherever possible.

IMPORTANT: Do NOT modify the UI layout, styling, or component structure. The visual UI should remain exactly as it is. Only adjust backend logic, data mapping, and functionality.

Please update the unified search and related logic as follows:

1) Adjust unified search behavior inside GET /api/search:
   - Continue using Repliers as the primary source for listing data:
       • status=active or status=under_contract → use Repliers API.
       • status=closed or status=sold → first try Repliers for sold/closed results.
   - Only when Repliers cannot return results for closed/sold should the system fall back to our local PostgreSQL database (historical MLS Grid data).
   - Preserve the normalized data shape and numeric types, including:
       id
       address
       city
       state
       postalCode
       listPrice
       closePrice
       status
       beds
       baths
       livingArea
       yearBuilt
       latitude
       longitude
       photos[]
       daysOnMarket
       cumulativeDaysOnMarket
       lotSizeSquareFeet
       lotSizeAcres
       garageSpaces
       closeDate

2) Ensure the Buyer Search page is fully wired to this updated unified search:
   - The existing fields and “Search Properties” button should call /api/search with the correct parameters.
   - Active searches should clearly be using Repliers as the source.
   - Closed/sold searches should use Repliers first, and fall back to the database only as needed.
   - Keep the existing card UI; do not modify layout or styling.

3) Ensure CMA calculations use the normalized listing data:
   - CMA statistics (min, max, average, median, price per square foot, days on market) must be computed only from the listings selected by the user.
   - CMA should work consistently whether listings came from Repliers or from the fallback database.
   - No CMA UI changes; only backend data loading, mapping, and calculations should be updated.

4) Provide a test address:
   - Please provide a real, verifiable property address that returns correct and complete results from Repliers.
   - Then verify that the same property can be retrieved through:
       • The unified /api/search endpoint
       • The Buyer Search UI
       • The Property Detail view
   - This will allow us to confirm that the integration is functioning consistently across the backend and frontend.
