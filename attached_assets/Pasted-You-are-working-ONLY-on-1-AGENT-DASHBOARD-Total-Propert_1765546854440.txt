You are working ONLY on:
1) AGENT DASHBOARD (Total Properties, Inventory by Type/Subtype, Recent Sold/Closed widget)
2) AGENT PROPERTIES module (inventory header, property subtype acronyms, search/view results)
NOT CMA pages, NOT IDX/public pages.

All property data must come from Repliers. Leasing/rentals must be excluded globally.
Goal: Make data counts consistent across Dashboard + Properties, fix Recent Sold/Closed behavior, add acronym tooltips, and fix multi-status Cherry Creek error.

====================================================
1) DATA CONSISTENCY — TOTAL PROPERTIES + INVENTORIES MUST MATCH EVERYWHERE
====================================================

Problem:
- Dashboard “Total Properties” and “Property Inventory by Type” do not match the Properties page totals/inventories.
- Data source and inventory must be consistent across all sections.

Requirements:
1) Create a SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH for:
   - Total Properties (Active + Under Contract + Sold/Closed, after rental exclusion)
   - Inventory by Status
   - Inventory by Property Type/Subtype
2) Both Dashboard and Properties pages MUST use the same backend endpoint / shared service to retrieve these counts.
3) Ensure both pages:
   - Use the same filters (especially rental exclusion)
   - Use the same status mapping rules
   - Use the same subtype mapping rules
4) Add server-side logs (temporary debug) verifying:
   - total counts returned for dashboard vs properties use the same method
   - any differences are eliminated

Testing:
- Load Dashboard counts.
- Load Properties counts.
- Confirm totals and inventory breakdowns match exactly for the same scope.

====================================================
2) DASHBOARD — RECENT SOLD/CLOSED LIST (MOST RECENT ONLY + FULL SCROLL)
====================================================

Problems:
- Recent Sold/Closed should show ONLY the most recent records.
- If it displays “100 total sold”, user must be able to scroll/page through ALL the way to the last record.

Requirements:
1) “Recent Sold/Closed” must be strictly sorted by newest close date first.
2) Show only the most recent items initially (e.g., first 10–20 in the UI).
3) Enable pagination/infinite scroll so user can continue until the final sold record:
   - If total sold = 100, the UI must allow browsing all 100.
4) Ensure performance:
   - Use paginated API calls (limit/offset or cursor-based).
   - Do NOT fetch all 100+ records in one request.
5) Clicking an item still opens the floating property card.

Testing:
- Confirm order is newest → oldest.
- Confirm scrolling/paging reaches the last record without breaking.
- Confirm total count displayed matches the number of available records.

====================================================
3) PROPERTIES SECTION — ACRONYM TOOLTIP FOR PROPERTY TYPES
====================================================

Problem:
- Property types are shown as acronyms and users need clarity.

Requirements:
1) Add an info icon (ⓘ) beside the property type acronyms section.
2) On hover (desktop) show a tooltip listing:
   - Each acronym
   - Full meaning (example: “SFR = Single Family Residence”)
3) On mobile/touch:
   - Tap icon to open/close the tooltip.
4) Keep tooltip concise and readable.

Testing:
- Hover shows tooltip on desktop.
- Tap works on mobile emulation.

====================================================
4) PROPERTIES SECTION — CHERRY CREEK + ALL STATUSES ERROR
====================================================

Problem:
- When Subdivision = Cherry Creek and ALL statuses are enabled (Active + Under Contract + Closed),
  View Result shows: “Error loading properties. Please try again or modify your search criteria”.

Requirements:
1) Reproduce the issue exactly:
   - Subdivision: Cherry Creek
   - Status: Active ON, Under Contract ON, Closed ON
2) Identify root cause:
   - Backend query building invalid status filter
   - Status filter incorrectly uses AND instead of OR
   - UI sends empty/invalid status array
   - Backend mapping filtering out everything post-fetch
   - Repliers API constraints (request too large / rate limit / validation error)
3) Fix logic so multi-status = UNION (OR):
   - Selecting multiple statuses should return results for ANY of the selected statuses.
   - “All statuses” must work reliably.
4) Improve error handling:
   - Log the exact Repliers request and response error code/message.
   - Return a clearer UI error if it’s a Repliers-side validation issue.
5) Ensure results load for Cherry Creek with all statuses ON without error.

Testing:
- Run the same Cherry Creek search with all statuses ON:
  - Confirm results load successfully.
- Confirm Active-only, UC-only, Closed-only searches also work.

====================================================
FINAL REPORT REQUIRED
====================================================

Provide:
1) The single backend method/endpoint used to unify counts across Dashboard + Properties.
2) Proof totals/inventories match across both pages.
3) Recent Sold/Closed pagination design (limit/cursor) and confirmation it reaches last record.
4) Tooltip mapping for property type acronyms.
5) Root cause + fix for Cherry Creek multi-status error with logs/screenshots.
