You are working ONLY on the AGENT “Properties” module header area (NOT CMA, NOT IDX/public pages).

Goal:
Replace the subtitle text under the “Properties” header (“Search and browse property listings”) with a dynamic, accurate summary from the ACTIVE data source, including:
- Total properties available in the current data source
- Inventory counts by Status
- Inventory counts by Property Subtype
- A hover-only info icon explaining data source + last updated timestamp

Data source:
Use the SAME data source currently powering Properties results (ex: Repliers API). Do NOT show MLS Grid if Properties is using Repliers.

====================================================
1) REPLACE SUBTITLE WITH DYNAMIC INVENTORY SUMMARY
====================================================

Current:
- Under “Properties” header → “Search and browse property listings”

Replace with:
A compact summary line + chips/badges that are dynamically computed and refreshed.

Requirements:
1) Show total property count from the ACTIVE data source:
   - Example: “Total properties in Repliers: 65,649”
   - If the active source changes in the future, text must automatically adapt (no hardcoded “Repliers”).
2) Total count must update whenever the integration refreshes or data is re-synced.
3) Under/next to the total count, show inventory breakdowns:

A) Inventory by Status (counts):
- Active (N)
- Under Contract (N)
- Closed/Sold (N)

B) Inventory by Property Subtype (counts):
- Single Family Residence (N)
- Condominium (N)
- Townhouse (N)
- Multi-Family (N)
- Land/Ranch (N)
- Other/Unknown (N)

4) These counts must be computed from the SAME dataset universe used by Properties search results (post server-side filtering rules such as rental/leasing exclusion if applicable).

====================================================
2) INFO ICON WITH HOVER TOOLTIP (HOVER-ONLY)
====================================================

Add an information icon (ⓘ) next to the new subtitle/summary.

Requirements:
- Tooltip ONLY appears on hover (mouse over), not always visible.
- Tooltip content must include:
  1) Data Source name (dynamic)
  2) A short explanation: “Data pulled from <source>”
  3) “Last updated: <timestamp>”
     - This timestamp must be real and sourced from the backend integration logs (not static).
- On mobile/touch devices:
  - If hover isn’t possible, allow tap to toggle the tooltip.

====================================================
3) BACKEND SUPPORT (IF NEEDED)
====================================================

If the frontend currently does not have:
- total count
- status counts
- subtype counts
- last updated timestamp

Then:
1) Add a backend endpoint or extend the existing Properties search metadata response to include:
   - totalAvailable
   - countsByStatus
   - countsBySubtype
   - dataSourceName
   - lastUpdatedAt

2) Ensure these values are:
   - fast to load (cached is okay)
   - accurate for the active integration
   - updated after sync/refresh jobs

====================================================
4) UI / UX REQUIREMENTS
====================================================

- Must look professional and clean for real estate agents.
- Keep it compact (one summary line + small chips).
- If counts are not available, display a clear fallback:
  - “Inventory unavailable” and still show the info icon with last updated if possible.
- Do NOT show conflicting wording like “MLS Grid” if data source is Repliers.

====================================================
TESTING REQUIRED
====================================================

1) Load Properties page:
   - Confirm subtitle is replaced with total count + inventory chips.
2) Hover info icon:
   - Tooltip shows data source + last updated timestamp.
3) Trigger a data refresh/sync:
   - Confirm “Last updated” changes appropriately.
   - Confirm total count and inventory chips remain consistent.

====================================================
FINAL REPORT REQUIRED
====================================================

Provide:
- Which component(s) were updated in the Properties header.
- Where the counts and lastUpdated timestamp are sourced from.
- Proof tooltip is hover-only and works on desktop + mobile.
- Confirmation no CMA/IDX/public pages were modified.
