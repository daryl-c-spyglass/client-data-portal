I am attaching:

- The Quick CMA PDF for Cherry Creek from a 3rd-party system.
- Screenshots showing:
  • Cherry Creek property search results
  • Property detail page where images and details are missing

Please apply the following fixes based on these references.

==================================================
1) Property Images Missing (List View + Detail View)
==================================================

None of the property photos appear in the Properties → View Results page or the Property Detail page. Only placeholders are shown, even though Repliers provides real image URLs.

Fix required:
- Ensure normalized Repliers listings include a `photos` array (from `media`, `images`, or `photos`).
- Use `photos[0]` as the property card thumbnail.
- Display a full gallery in the property detail page.
- Use fallback placeholder **only when no photos exist**.

Update both:
- List view (Properties → View Results)
- Property detail view.

==================================================
2) Cherry Creek Search – Incorrect Behavior
==================================================

When searching subdivision **Cherry Creek**, the behavior is incorrect:

Expected (based on Quick CMA):
- Active: Should return several listings (around 3 Active).
- Under Contract: Should show AUC properties (around 2).
Actual:
- The app returns 0 or inconsistent results.

Closed listings:
- The app shows 16 listings, but unclear if they match Repliers data.

Fix required:
- Confirm subdivision filter uses: Subdivision LIKE "Cherry Creek%".
- Ensure status mapping aligns with Repliers:
  • A = Active
  • U = Active Under Contract
  • P = Pending
  • S = Sold
- Ensure sqft filter (1200–1800) works correctly.
- Ensure property type filter pulls correct subtype (Single Family).

==================================================
3) CMA Math Must Match the Quick CMA PDF
==================================================

The example Quick CMA for Cherry Creek (1200–1800 sqft) shows:

- 4 closed comps
- Avg Close Price ≈ $584,500  
- Median Close Price ≈ $570,000  
- Avg $/sqft ≈ $351.45  
- Median $/sqft ≈ $344.07  

Current CMA builder is producing incorrect numbers (e.g., ~$575K for million-dollar listings), meaning:

- Numeric fields may be strings.
- Wrong fields may be mapped.
- Wrong listings may be included.

Fix required:
- Use correct numeric fields from Repliers:
  • `listPrice`
  • `closePrice`
  • `livingArea`
  • `beds`, `baths`
- Fix CMA calculations:
  • Avg / Median price
  • Avg / Median $/sqft
  • DOM
- Ensure CMA stats are calculated ONLY from selected comparables.
- Reproduce the Cherry Creek CMA (using the same comps) and ensure values match the PDF.

==================================================
4) Missing Property Information (Detail Page)
==================================================

These sections are empty even though Repliers provides data:

- Description
- Features & Amenities
- Property History
- Neighborhood

Fix required:
- Map Repliers fields:
  • Description → `publicRemarks`
  • Features & Amenities → `interiorFeatures`, `exteriorFeatures`, `communityFeatures`, `lotFeatures`, etc.
  • Property History → use any available history or show a clear fallback.
  • Neighborhood → subdivision name, city, MLS area, ZIP

==================================================
Summary of Required Fixes
==================================================

1. Fix property images in both list view and detail view using Repliers `photos[]`.  
2. Correct Cherry Creek search logic: subdivision filtering, status mapping, property subtype, and sqft filtering.  
3. Correct CMA math and validate by reproducing the Cherry Creek CMA from the PDF.  
4. Populate all missing property detail sections using appropriate Repliers fields.  
5. Keep UI unchanged; only fix the underlying data mapping, search logic, and CMA calculation issues.

Please use the attached Quick CMA PDF and screenshots as references when applying these fixes.
