You are working ONLY on the CMA module → “Create New CMA” → Search Results (NOT IDX or public search).

Issue:
When I search CMAs with:
- Subdivision: Cherry Creek
- Property Type: Single Family Residence
- Status: Sold

…the Search Results still show obviously low-price “sales” (e.g. $1,800, $1,850, $1,895, $1,400, $1,395, $2,200). These are actually rentals/leases that should not appear in a Sold CMA search.

The rental filtering you recently added only affects the CMA Detail / Analysis endpoint, not the initial CMA Search Results.

Use the attached screenshot as reference: results include properties like:
- 8602 Bisbee Ct – $1,895
- 2830 Gettysburg Dr – $2,200
- 8504 Apple Carric Cv #B – $1,400
- 5936 Cherry Loop #A – $1,395
- 3318 Silkgrass Bnd – $1,800
…all with “Sold” badges but clearly rental-style pricing.

========================================
1) Apply rental filtering to CMA Search Results
========================================

Requirements:

1. Reuse the centralized rental detection logic you already created:
   - `isLikelyRentalProperty()`
   - `filterOutRentalProperties()`
   - in `shared/schema.ts`

2. In the CMA **search endpoint** used by “Create New CMA”:
   - After fetching properties from Repliers, but BEFORE returning them to the frontend:
     • Call `filterOutRentalProperties()` to remove any likely rentals from the result set.
   - This must be done for ALL status filters in the CMA search, especially:
     • Sold / Closed
     • Active
     • Under Contract

3. Ensure that:
   - The “Search Results (N found)” count reflects the filtered list (rentals are not counted).
   - The UI only shows true sale listings (e.g., $188,000, $214,000, $292,000, etc.), not monthly rent amounts.

========================================
2) Confirm property type & status behavior
========================================

1. Verify that when the user selects:
   - Property Type = Single Family Residence
   - Status = Sold
   - Subdivision = Cherry Creek

…the backend:
   - Filters ONLY Single Family Residential sale listings.
   - Excludes rental/lease records, even if they are marked as “Sold” or “Closed” in the MLS but priced like rent.

2. Make sure the same rental detection is NOT limited to the CMA Detail endpoint; it must be consistently used in:
   - CMA search results endpoint
   - CMA detail/analysis endpoint
   - Any other CMA endpoints that surface comparable lists.

========================================
3) Testing you MUST perform
========================================

1. Run a CMA search with:
   - Subdivision: Cherry Creek
   - Property Type: Single Family Residence
   - Status: Sold

2. Verify:
   - The low-price rentals ($1,395–$2,200) are NO LONGER present in Search Results.
   - Only realistic sale prices remain (e.g., $188k, $214k, $292k, $297.5k, $330k, $401k, etc.).
   - “Search Results (N found)” count matches the number of non-rental properties shown.

3. Generate a CMA from these search results and confirm:
   - Rentals are still properly filtered out in:
     • Properties Used in Analysis
     • Market Stats
     • Timeline
     • Any other CMA lists.

========================================
4) Report back
========================================

In your final notes, please include:
- Which CMA search endpoint(s) you updated to use `filterOutRentalProperties()`.
- A list of at least 3 addresses that were previously shown as low-price rentals and are now correctly filtered out in CMA searches.
- Confirmation that the Cherry Creek Single Family / Sold search returns only true sale comps with realistic prices.
