Replit Prompt: Add Animated “Line Pagination” Indicator to Marketing Insights Carousel

In the Dashboard → Marketing Insights section, we have a carousel of charts. I want a minimal line-style pagination indicator like the highlighted yellow area in the screenshot: multiple thin lines representing slides, where the active line is filled/animated and updates interactively when the carousel changes slides.

Requirements

Line indicator UI

Display a horizontal row of thin pill/lines centered under the carousel (or aligned with existing nav).

One line per slide.

Inactive lines: low-contrast neutral (e.g., gray with opacity).

Active line: higher contrast (e.g., black/primary) and optionally slightly longer.

Interactive animation

When the carousel moves to the next/prev slide (by arrows, swipe/drag, dots, or programmatic change), the active line updates immediately.

Animate the active line “fill”:

Either a left-to-right fill animation

Or smooth transition of width/opacity on the active line

Use CSS transitions; avoid heavy animation libs unless already used.

Clickable

Clicking a line jumps to that slide.

Add accessible labels: aria-label="Go to slide 2".

Works with dynamic slides

The indicator count should come from the number of marketing insight charts rendered (do not hardcode number of slides).

No regressions

Must not break existing carousel controls.

Must stay in sync even when filters change (if slides/data re-render).

Implementation Instructions (must follow)
Step 1: Identify carousel implementation

Locate the Marketing Insights carousel component. Determine whether it uses:

shadcn/ui Carousel (Embla)

Swiper

a custom scroll-snap carousel
Then implement the indicator using the carousel’s active index state.

Step 2: Add activeIndex state + slide count

Ensure the carousel exposes:

current slide index (activeIndex)

slide count (slides.length)

a method to scrollTo(index)

Step 3: Create a reusable indicator component

Create a component like:

MarketingCarouselIndicator
Props:

count: number

activeIndex: number

onSelect: (index: number) => void

optional progress?: number if you support fill animation per slide

Step 4: Add the line styles

Use Tailwind (if available) or CSS module:

Container: flex gap-2 justify-center items-center

Each line: h-[3px] rounded-full transition-all duration-300

Inactive: bg-gray-300/60 w-10

Active: bg-gray-900 w-14 (or same width but higher opacity)

Optional (recommended): “fill” effect inside the active line:

Outer track: gray

Inner fill: black, animate width from 0→100% when slide becomes active

Step 5: Wire up click-to-slide

Clicking a line should scroll to that slide using the carousel API.

Output Required

When done, show:

Files changed

Where activeIndex is derived

How indicator stays synced to slide changes

Confirm lines are clickable + animated

Now implement this in the Marketing Insights dashboard section.

If you’re using shadcn/ui Carousel (Embla)…

Use Embla’s on('select') to track active index, and emblaApi.scrollTo(i) when clicking a line indicator.

If you’re using scroll-snap…

Compute active index on scroll using IntersectionObserver or scroll position and set state accordingly.
