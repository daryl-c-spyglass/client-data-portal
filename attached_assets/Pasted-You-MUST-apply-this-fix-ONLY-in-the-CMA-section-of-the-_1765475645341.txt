You MUST apply this fix ONLY in the CMA section of the app.

Scope:
- Page: “Create New CMA” (screenshot shows title: “Create New CMA”)
- Path: CMAs → Create New CMA
- Sections on this page:
  • CMA Information
  • Search Properties
  • Subject Property
  • Comparable Properties
  • Analysis
  • Search Results

Do NOT touch:
- IDX search pages
- Public listing detail pages
- VOW or any consumer site
- MLS Grid admin or any non-CMA modules

====================================================
BUG 1: Grey block on CMA floating card image
====================================================

Context:
On the Create New CMA page:
- User fills Search Properties, gets results in “Search Results”.
- User clicks a property → a floating card/modal opens with:
  • Property address as title
  • Large photo at the top with slide counter (e.g. “8 / 25”)
  • Status badge (Active / Under Contract / Sold/Closed)
  • Price and property stats
- In this floating card, a GREY RECTANGLE still shows on the lower-left part of the image.

Requirements:
1. Inspect ONLY the image/carousel area in the CMA floating card and find the element creating the grey block:
   - Look at:
     • Carousel wrappers
     • Arrow containers
     • Pagination bullets/containers
     • Placeholder/mask divs
     • Any absolutely positioned overlays

2. Remove or restyle the offending element so:
   - No grey area is visible over the image.
   - The image area contains ONLY:
     • The listing photo
     • The centered slide counter (e.g. “8 / 25”)
     • Back/forward controls

3. Confirm this fix applies for ALL CMA statuses:
   - Active listings
   - Under Contract listings
   - Sold/Closed listings

4. Confirm on both desktop and a mobile-width viewport.

====================================================
BUG 2: Left/right image click zones not working
====================================================

Desired behavior in the CMA floating card (ONLY here):

- Clicking the LEFT side/half of the image:
  → Moves to the PREVIOUS photo.

- Clicking the RIGHT side/half of the image:
  → Moves to the NEXT photo.

Current behavior: these clicks do NOT navigate.

Requirements:
1. Implement left/right click zones on the CMA floating card image:
   - Either:
     • Two invisible overlays (left and right halves), OR
     • Single click handler that checks click X position vs image midpoint.
   - Zones must:
     • Cover full image height
     • Cover exactly half width each
     • Be invisible (no visible grey/colored blocks)

2. Hook into the CMA carousel navigation:
   - Left zone → call “previous slide”
   - Right zone → call “next slide”

3. Preserve existing autoplay:
   - Images auto-advance every ~3 seconds.
   - After manual click, autoplay pauses briefly then resumes.

4. This behavior must work for all CMA listings:
   - Active, Under Contract, Sold/Closed.

====================================================
MANDATORY TESTS (IN CMA ONLY)
====================================================

You MUST follow these tests on the “Create New CMA” page:

1. Run a CMA search from the Search Properties section so Search Results are populated.
2. Click an Active listing → floating card opens.
   - NO grey block on image.
   - Click left half → previous photo.
   - Click right half → next photo.
   - Carousel still auto-plays and resumes after clicks.

3. Repeat step 2 for:
   - An Under Contract listing.
   - A Sold/Closed listing.

4. Confirm that no IDX / public search / non-CMA page was modified.

====================================================
FINAL REPORT (REQUIRED)
====================================================

Your final output MUST include:

1. The exact DOM element(s) that caused the grey overlay (component name + class/id).
2. The exact CSS/JS changes made (file names + selectors/functions).
3. How left/right click zones were implemented.
4. Confirmation that all tests above passed on the Create New CMA page ONLY and that no other sections (IDX, VOW, public search) were touched.
