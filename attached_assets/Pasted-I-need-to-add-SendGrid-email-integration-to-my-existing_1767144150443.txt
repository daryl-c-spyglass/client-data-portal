I need to add SendGrid email integration to my existing Seller Updates feature. Here's what I need:

## What Exists
- Seller Updates UI where agents can create updates with: update name, client email, zip code, and property criteria
- MLS Grid API integration that pulls property data by zip code
- Database with seller_updates table storing the update configurations
- Agents and clients tables already exist

## What I Need Built

### 1. Database Schema Updates
Add these columns to seller_updates table:
- frequency (enum: 'weekly', 'bimonthly', 'quarterly') 
- last_sent_at (timestamp)
- next_send_at (timestamp)
- is_active (boolean, default true)

### 2. SendGrid Email Service
Create a service module that:
- Uses @sendgrid/mail package
- Sends from: updates@spyglassrealty.com (env var: SENDGRID_FROM_EMAIL)
- Sets reply-to as the individual agent's email (from agents table)
- Uses SendGrid dynamic templates (I'll create the template in SendGrid UI)
- Passes these dynamic template variables: client_name, agent_name, agent_email, agent_phone, update_name, properties array, market_stats object, current_date
- Enables open and click tracking

### 3. Scheduled Job
Create a cron job that:
- Runs daily at 9 AM Central time
- Queries seller_updates where is_active=true AND next_send_at <= NOW()
- For each due update: fetches fresh MLS data for that zip, calculates market stats, sends email via SendGrid
- On successful send: updates last_sent_at to NOW() and calculates next_send_at based on frequency

### 4. API Endpoints
- POST /api/seller-updates/:id/send-test - sends a test email to the agent's email
- POST /api/seller-updates/:id/toggle-active - activates/deactivates the update
- GET /api/seller-updates/:id/history - returns send history for that update

### 5. UI Updates
On the Create Seller Update form, add:
- Frequency dropdown (Weekly, Twice Monthly, Quarterly)
- Active/Inactive toggle
- "Send Test Email" button
- Show last_sent_at and next_send_at dates

## Environment Variables Needed
- SENDGRID_API_KEY
- SENDGRID_FROM_EMAIL=updates@spyglassrealty.com
- SENDGRID_TEMPLATE_ID (I'll add this after creating the template)

## Notes
- Don't store email content in database, just send history/logs
- Use node-cron for scheduling
- Handle errors gracefully and log failed sends for retry
