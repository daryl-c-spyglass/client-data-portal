You are working ONLY on CMA → Create New CMA → Search Results (NOT IDX).

Issue:
Active and Under Contract CMA search results still show low-dollar properties such as:
- $1,395
- $1,400
- $1,800
- $1,895
- $2,200

These amounts are rental/lease prices and should NEVER appear under:
- Active (for-sale)
- Under Contract (for-sale)
- Sold (for-sale)

We already implemented rental filtering inside CMA Detail/Analysis, but the filtering was NOT applied to CMA Search Results. As a result, rental properties are still appearing in Active & UC searches.

=====================================
REQUIRED FIX
=====================================

1. Apply the same rental filtering logic to the CMA Search Results endpoint.

Use functions in shared/schema.ts:
- isLikelyRentalProperty()
- filterOutRentalProperties()

2. After fetching properties from Repliers in the CMA search API:
   - Filter OUT rental listings BEFORE returning them to the frontend.
   - This MUST apply to ALL selected statuses:
     • Active
     • Under Contract
     • Sold/Closed

3. The “Search Results (N found)” count must use the filtered list.

4. Confirm property type filtering is respected:
   - Only include Single Family Residence sale listings.
   - Rental or lease listings, even if marked Active/UC, must be excluded.

=====================================
TESTING REQUIRED
=====================================

1. Perform a CMA search with:
   - Subdivision: Cherry Creek
   - Property Type: Single Family Residence
   - Status: Active
   - Status: Under Contract

2. Confirm:
   - Rental-price listings ($1,395–$2,200) NO LONGER appear.
   - Only real for-sale listings with realistic pricing ($300k–$600k+) show.

3. Repeat the same check for Sold listings.

=====================================
FINAL REPORT
=====================================

Include:
- Which endpoints were updated.
- Which rental properties are now correctly filtered out.
- Confirmation that Active, UC, and Sold CMA searches now return ONLY real for-sale comps.
