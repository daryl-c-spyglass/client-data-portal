I have more follow-up issues based on the latest build. Please treat these as incremental to my previous prompts.

=====================================

Sold/Closed Results – Austin + Barton Hills
=====================================

In Search Properties, when I use:

City: Austin

Subdivision: Barton Hills

Status: Sold/Closed

I am getting no results.

Please verify:

That this combination actually has Sold/Closed listings in Repliers.

That the query is correctly filtering by subdivision + city + status.

If Repliers has Sold/Closed listings for this filter, fix the search logic so those listings appear.

=====================================
2) Carousel Arrows Positioning on Property Detail

In the property detail / image viewer, when I click a property in search results:

The arrow controls for previous/next are not placed directly on or next to the image area.

It feels like the arrows are not clearly tied to the image carousel.

Required behavior:

The left/right arrows should be visually attached to the image frame (overlayed on the sides, or immediately adjacent).

Clicking the arrows should clearly move the currently visible image forward/backward in the carousel.

Autoplay every ~3 seconds should still work, but manual arrows must override and feel natural.

=====================================
3) “Modify Search” – CMA Name Duplicating “(Modified)”

In the yellow bar, when I click Modify Search:

The CMA name gets “(Modified)” appended every time I modify and save.

Example:
Barton Hills West - Sold/Closed & Active - 12/11/2025 3:26 AM (Modified) (Modified)

Fix the naming logic so:

“(Modified)” is added at most once, or

We use a cleaner pattern (e.g., overwrite any existing “(Modified)” suffix instead of stacking multiple copies).

=====================================
4) Info Tooltips – Home Averages / Listings / Timeline / Market Stats

When I hover the info icons (or tooltips) for:

Home Averages

Listings

Timeline

Market Stats

The tooltip text is cut off / clipped and not fully readable.

Please adjust:

Tooltip width and positioning so the entire help text is readable.

Allow wrapping to multiple lines if needed.

Ensure this works on desktop resolutions (like the screenshots I provided).

=====================================
5) Market Stats – Under Contract Section Empty (Specific CMA)

Using this CMA report as a test case:

“Barton Hills West - Sold/Closed & Active - 12/11/2025 3:26 AM (Modified) (Modified)”

In Market Stats → Property Status Breakdown, the Under Contract section shows no results.

I want this section (and the others) to show:

The list of addresses that are under contract.

Key information (price, beds, baths, sqft, DOM, property type).

A property picture/thumbnail for each listing.

Please:

Confirm whether there are Under Contract comparables feeding this CMA from Repliers.

If yes, fix the logic so those listings appear under Under Contract with full details and images.

Make sure the behavior is consistent for Active, Under Contract, and Closed/Sold across Market Stats.

=====================================
6) Match PDF Layout to Share Link Layout

I like the data layout and structure shown in the Share Link view.

Please update the PDF export so that:

The PDF output matches the same layout, section order, and data presentation as the Share Link view.

Wherever possible, reuse the same components/structure so the client experience is consistent between:

In-app Share Link view

Exported PDF report

Please implement these fixes while keeping the existing UI layout and styling. Focus on search accuracy (especially Sold/Closed for Austin + Barton Hills), proper carousel controls, clean CMA naming on Modify Search, readable tooltips, complete Market Stats breakdown (with addresses/info/photos), and making the PDF output match the Share Link format.
