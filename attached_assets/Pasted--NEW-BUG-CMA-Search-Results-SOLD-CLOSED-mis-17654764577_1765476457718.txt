NEW BUG – CMA Search Results (SOLD/CLOSED) missing photos
====================================================

Scope:
- Create New CMA → Search Results section
- Floating card/modal that opens when clicking a SOLD/CLOSED listing
- ONLY inside the CMA flow (do not touch IDX or public search)

Problem:
- For SOLD/CLOSED listings in CMA Search Results:
  - Thumbnail image on the result card is blank / generic icon only.
  - Floating card image area is also blank / generic icon only.
  - This happens even when the data source (Repliers) has no photos.

Requirements:

1) Always attempt to load photos from Repliers
   - Use Repliers photo/media fields for SOLD/CLOSED listings exactly the same as for Active/Under Contract.
   - If Repliers returns one or more photos:
     • Show the primary photo as the thumbnail in Search Results.
     • Show full carousel in the floating card (with autoplay + arrows as previously specified).

2) Explicit placeholder when NO photos exist
   - If Repliers returns NO photos for the listing (empty array / null / error):
     • Show a clear message INSIDE the image box, both:
       - On the Search Results thumbnail
       - On the floating card image area
     • Text should clearly state, for example:
       “No photos available for this property”
     • Keep the box styling consistent (same size, background), but ensure the text is readable and centered.

3) Do NOT silently fail
   - Do not leave the box with only a generic icon and no explanation.
   - Always show either:
     • Real images from Repliers, OR
     • The explicit “No photos available for this property” message.

Testing (CMA ONLY):
- Run a CMA search where at least one SOLD/CLOSED listing has photos in Repliers:
  • Confirm Search Results thumbnail and floating card show the real photos.
- Run a CMA search where a SOLD/CLOSED listing has NO photos in Repliers:
  • Confirm both the thumbnail and the floating card image area show:
    “No photos available for this property”.
- Confirm Active and Under Contract behavior are unchanged.
