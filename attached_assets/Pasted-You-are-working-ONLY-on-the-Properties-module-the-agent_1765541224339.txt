You are working ONLY on the “Properties” module (the agent-facing Properties search experience),
NOT CMA pages, NOT IDX/public pages.

Data source: Repliers (and/or whatever the Properties module is configured to use).
You MUST clearly expose which data source is being used and ensure results are accurate and consistent.

====================================================
1) SHOW DATA SOURCE + INVENTORY SUMMARY (STATUS + SUBTYPE)
====================================================

Problem:
- The Properties page shows a number of properties but it’s unclear which data source it came from.
- We also need a quick inventory summary by status and property subtype.

Requirements:
1) Add a clear label near the total results count:
   - Example: “Data Source: Repliers”
   - If multiple sources are possible, show the active one explicitly.

2) Add an inventory summary panel (or compact chips) that updates with every search:
   - Inventory by Status (counts):
     • Active
     • Under Contract
     • Sold/Closed
     • Any other supported statuses
   - Inventory by Property Subtype (counts):
     • Single Family Residence
     • Condominium
     • Townhouse
     • Multi-Family / Duplex
     • Land / Ranch (if applicable)
     • Other/Unknown

3) These counts must reflect the same dataset as the results list (post-filtering).
4) If there are 0 results, inventory summary must show zeros (not blank / not missing).

Testing:
- Run a search that returns results → verify counts match list totals.
- Run a search that returns 0 results → verify inventory still renders.

====================================================
2) REORDER THE VIEW FLOW: Search Criteria → View Result → View Map
====================================================

Problem:
- The order of sections/tabs is not aligned with desired workflow.

Requirements:
- Reorder the UI so the default left-to-right (or top-to-bottom) flow is:
  1) Search Criteria
  2) View Result
  3) View Map
- Ensure this order is consistent on desktop and mobile.
- Ensure the selected tab persists while navigating within Properties.

Testing:
- Load Properties page → confirm Search Criteria is first, View Result second, View Map last.

====================================================
3) PRESERVE FILTERS WHEN USING BACK/UNDO (DO NOT RESET)
====================================================

Problem:
- After performing a search and landing in View Result, using browser back/undo can clear filters/selections unintentionally.

Requirements:
1) Persist the user’s search criteria and selections when:
   - user clicks Back
   - user switches between View Result and Search Criteria
   - user navigates within Properties and returns

2) Filters MUST NOT be cleared unless the user explicitly clicks:
   - Reset button (the ONLY action that clears filters)

Implementation guidance:
- Use URL query params and/or route state to restore filters reliably.
- Ensure pagination/sort state is preserved too if applicable.

Testing:
- Set multiple filters → run search → go to View Result
- Click Back or return to Search Criteria
- Confirm filters remain exactly the same until user presses Reset.

====================================================
4) BUG INVESTIGATION: Subdivision “Barton Hills” RESULTS INCORRECT
====================================================

Problem:
- Searching Subdivision = “Barton Hills” returns incorrect results.

Requirements:
1) Reproduce:
   - Search Criteria: Subdivision “Barton Hills” (and any other required defaults)
2) Validate:
   - Which field is being queried for subdivision (SubdivisionName? Neighborhood? Area? MLSSubdivision?)
   - Whether matching is exact vs partial vs normalized (case/spacing)
3) Fix subdivision matching:
   - Must use the correct Repliers field(s) for subdivision.
   - Must handle common variations:
     • “Barton Hills”
     • “Barton Hills West”
     • “Barton Hills East”
   - If you use partial matching, ensure it does not pull unrelated neighborhoods.

4) Add diagnostic logging (server-side) for this search:
   - the final query sent to Repliers
   - the field used for subdivision filtering
   - result count before/after filters

Testing:
- Search “Barton Hills” → confirm returned properties are truly in that subdivision.
- Cross-check at least 3 returned records show the correct subdivision value in the property details.

====================================================
5) BUG INVESTIGATION: City “Austin” + ALL STATUSES → BLANK RESULTS
====================================================

Problem:
- Turning ON all statuses for City = Austin returns blank/no results.

Requirements:
1) Reproduce:
   - City = Austin
   - Status = “All” (or all status toggles selected)
2) Identify whether the issue is:
   - Status filter building an invalid query
   - Status filter using AND instead of OR
   - Repliers API status values mismatch with our UI values
   - UI incorrectly sending empty statuses array
   - Backend mapping filtering out everything post-fetch

3) Fix the logic so:
   - Selecting multiple statuses returns the union (OR), not intersection (AND).
   - “All statuses” truly means no status restriction OR an OR across all statuses.
   - Results are not filtered to zero due to mapping issues.

4) Ensure “N found” and inventory summary reflect actual results.

Testing:
- City = Austin + All statuses:
  - Confirm results appear (non-empty).
- City = Austin + Active only:
  - Confirm results are a subset of the “All statuses” results.
- City = Austin + Under Contract only:
  - Confirm results appear (if any) and are not blocked by the multi-status logic.

====================================================
FINAL REPORT REQUIRED
====================================================

Provide:
1) Where “Data Source” label was added and how it is determined.
2) How status + subtype inventory counts are computed and verified.
3) How filter persistence was implemented (URL/state) and how Reset works.
4) Root cause + fix for:
   - Barton Hills subdivision incorrect results
   - Austin + All statuses blank results
5) Confirmation no CMA/IDX/public pages were modified.
