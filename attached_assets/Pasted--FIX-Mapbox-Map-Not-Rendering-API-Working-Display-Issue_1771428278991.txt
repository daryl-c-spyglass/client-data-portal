## FIX — Mapbox Map Not Rendering (API Working, Display Issue)

### CONTEXT

- Mapbox token is valid and working
- Network requests to api.mapbox.com return 200 OK
- Fonts, tiles, and styles are loading successfully
- But the map container appears empty/blank on the page

This is a CSS/rendering issue, not a token issue.

---

### DIAGNOSE

**1. Find the map container in PropertyDetail**

Search for the Location section and the MapboxMap component usage.

**2. Check for height issues**

Mapbox requires an explicit height on the container. If the container has `height: 0` or no height set, the map won't be visible even though it's initialized.

Look for:
```tsx
<MapboxMap 
  // ... props
  className="..."  // Does this have height?
  style={{ height: ??? }}  // Is height explicitly set?
/>
```

**3. Common causes:**

- Container has `height: auto` or no height (map needs explicit px or viewport height)
- Parent container has `overflow: hidden` with 0 height
- Map container has `display: none` or `visibility: hidden`
- Flexbox/grid parent not giving the map space

---

### LIKELY FIX

Ensure the map container has an explicit height:
```tsx
// In PropertyDetail.tsx, Location section:
<div className="h-[400px] w-full">  {/* Explicit height required */}
  <MapboxMap
    latitude={property.latitude}
    longitude={property.longitude}
    // ... other props
    className="h-full w-full rounded-lg"
  />
</div>
```

Or with inline style:
```tsx
<MapboxMap
  // ... props
  style={{ height: '400px', width: '100%' }}
/>
```

---

### TASKS

1. Find the MapboxMap usage in PropertyDetail.tsx (Location section)
2. Check what height is set on the map container
3. If height is missing or 0, add explicit height (e.g., `h-[400px]` or `style={{ height: '400px' }}`)
4. Verify the map renders after the fix

---

### ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA

1. Map visibly renders in the Location section
2. Map shows the property location with a marker
3. Map is responsive but has minimum height of 300-400px
