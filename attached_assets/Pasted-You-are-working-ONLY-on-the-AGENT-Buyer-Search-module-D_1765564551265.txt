You are working ONLY on the AGENT “Buyer Search” module + Dashboard Quick Actions (agent-facing).
Do NOT modify CMA pages, Properties module, Seller Updates, or IDX/public pages.

Data source: Repliers. Rental/leasing listings must be excluded globally.

Fix the Buyer Search issues ONE BY ONE and test each before moving to the next.

====================================================
1) BUYER SEARCH — “SAVE SEARCH” NOT WORKING
====================================================

Problems:
- Save Search cannot be used.
- User cannot select properties to be saved.

Requirements:
1) Identify why Save Search is disabled or failing:
   - UI button state logic
   - missing required fields
   - backend endpoint errors
   - auth/session issues
2) Fix Save Search so it:
   - Works end-to-end (UI → API → persistence → UI refresh)
   - Shows success/error messages (no silent failures)

3) Selection behavior:
- Allow user to select properties (checkbox or “save” icon per property card).
- Selected properties should be included in the saved search context OR saved list (define and implement clearly).
- Ensure selection persists when switching between List and Map views during the session.

Testing:
- Perform a Buyer Search → select 3 properties → Save Search → confirm it saves successfully and persists after refresh.

====================================================
2) BUYER SEARCH — DEFINE THE FLOW AFTER “SAVE SEARCH”
====================================================

Create a clear user flow after saving:

Requirements:
After Save Search is successful:
1) Show a confirmation toast:
   - “Search saved successfully”
2) Prompt user with next actions (modal or inline):
   - “View Saved Searches”
   - “Continue Browsing”
   - “Create CMA from Results” (optional if already supported)
3) Saved searches must appear in a “Saved Searches” section BELOW the search UI:
   - Each saved search shows:
     • Name (auto-generated if none)
     • Key filters summary (city/subdivision/price/etc.)
     • Created date/time
     • “Run Search” button
     • “Delete” button (optional if allowed)
4) Clicking “Run Search” loads the filters back into the UI and runs it.

Testing:
- Save a search → confirm it appears in the saved list → click Run Search → filters populate and results load.

====================================================
3) BUYER SEARCH — LIST FILTER NOT WORKING
====================================================

Problem:
- List filter (sorting/filtering on list results) is not working.

Requirements:
1) Identify which list filters exist (price, beds, baths, status, etc.)
2) Fix the filter logic so it:
   - Actually updates the displayed results
   - Works together with saved searches and map view
3) Ensure filters are applied consistently:
   - List view and Map view show the same filtered dataset.

Testing:
- Apply list filters → confirm results change accordingly.
- Switch to map → confirm map reflects same filtered dataset.

====================================================
4) BUYER SEARCH — MAP MUST SHOW CLICKABLE ADDRESSES + FLOATING CARD WITH IMAGES
====================================================

Problem:
- Map needs a better interaction and must show the comparable property addresses.

Requirements:
1) On Map view:
   - Display property markers.
   - Each marker must have a clickable address label (or a sidebar list showing addresses).
2) When user clicks an address (or marker):
   - Open a floating card/modal showing:
     • Address
     • Price
     • Status
     • Beds/Baths/Sqft/Year built
     • Subdivision + Neighborhood (separate fields if available)
     • MLS #
     • Property images
3) Image behavior in floating card:
   - Automatic carousel every 3 seconds
   - Manual navigation:
     - Clicking left side of image goes backward
     - Clicking right side goes forward
   - Do NOT show grey arrow overlays; left/right click zones only
   - If no photos: show “No photos available”

Testing:
- Run a Buyer Search → open Map view → click 3 different properties:
  - Floating card opens each time
  - Images auto-rotate every 3 seconds
  - Manual left/right click navigation works

====================================================
5) BUYER SEARCH — SAVED SEARCHES LIST BELOW
====================================================

Requirement:
- Saved searches must appear BELOW Buyer Search results section.
- Must include:
  - Search name
  - Summary of filters
  - Run Search
  - (Optional) Delete
- Ensure ordering newest → oldest by default.

Testing:
- Save 2 searches → confirm they appear below and newest is first.

====================================================
6) DASHBOARD — ADD “BUYER SEARCH” BUTTON IN QUICK ACTIONS + FIX SPACING
====================================================

Problem:
- Need a Buyer Search redirect button in Dashboard Quick Actions.
- Buttons spacing/sizing is leaving big empty gaps.

Requirements:
1) Add a “Buyer Search” shortcut button inside Dashboard → Quick Actions block.
2) Re-arrange quick action buttons so they are evenly sized and aligned:
   - No oversized empty space
   - Responsive layout (desktop and mobile)
3) Ensure clicking “Buyer Search” routes user to Buyer Search module.

Testing:
- Load dashboard → Quick Actions shows Buyer Search button.
- Click it → navigates correctly.
- Confirm layout looks clean with no awkward spacing.

====================================================
