You are working ONLY on the Agent-facing modules:
1) Properties section (agent property search/results UI)
2) Seller Updates section
3) CMA / Created CMA section (CMA Results UI)
NOT IDX/public pages.

Reference and align workflow to the “Quick Tutorial: Recent UI” video:
- Fast, guided actions
- Client-safe presentation
- Minimal friction
- Clear sharing and next steps

All property data must come from Repliers.
Leasing/rentals must be excluded globally from all pulls, counts, charts, and comps.

====================================================
A) PROPERTIES SECTION — FLOATING ACTION BUTTONS (LOWER RIGHT)
====================================================

Goal:
Add persistent floating buttons at the very lower-right corner of the Properties UI to streamline the “Quick CMA” video-like workflow.

Requirements:
1) Add a floating button group fixed at bottom-right:
   - Button 1: “Send Properties”
   - Button 2: “Quick CMA”
2) Visibility:
   - Buttons are always visible on Properties page (Search Criteria, View Result, View Map).
   - Do not cover key UI elements (respect safe margins for mobile).
3) Enable state:
   - Buttons are disabled until user has selected at least 1 property.
   - Show selection count on the button (e.g., “Send Properties (3)” / “Quick CMA (3)”).

Behavior:
1) “Send Properties”
   - Collect selected properties (IDs + basic display data) from the Properties result set.
   - Redirect to Seller Updates section.
   - Pre-fill Seller Updates with the selected properties (cards + links).
   - Ensure selections persist through navigation.
2) “Quick CMA”
   - Collect selected properties (IDs + data) and redirect to CMA section (Create CMA).
   - Pre-fill CMA comparable selection with those properties.
   - Ensure user can continue to CMA Results workflow without re-searching.

Technical:
- Use route state or sessionStorage for passing selected properties (do NOT persist permanently).
- Ensure the selected properties are fetched fresh from Repliers on destination page (avoid stale data).

Testing:
- Select 3 properties → click Send Properties → verify Seller Updates loads those 3.
- Select 3 properties → click Quick CMA → verify CMA loads those 3 as selected comps.
- Back navigation must not lose selection unless user clicks Reset.

====================================================
B) CMA / CREATED CMA SECTION — MAP + COMP LOCATIONS
====================================================

Goal:
Add a map to CMA Results showing the location of selected comparable properties (and subject if available).

Requirements:
1) Add a “Map” view/section in CMA Results:
   - Plot Subject property marker (distinct) if present.
   - Plot all selected comps markers.
2) Marker interaction:
   - Clicking a marker opens the standard floating card (same behavior as comps list).
3) Fit bounds:
   - Default map view should fit all markers.

Testing:
- Generate CMA with 5+ comps → confirm all markers appear and clicking opens floating card.

====================================================
C) CMA RESULTS — TIMELINE: DOT PLOT + NEW STATISTICS ROW TABLE
====================================================

Goal:
Return Timeline to a dot plot graph and add a statistics table under it for quick analysis.

Requirements:
1) Timeline chart:
   - Use DOT PLOT again (not line graph).
   - Dots represent comps over time with status indicator (Active/UC/Sold).
   - Tooltip shows price, status, date, and DOM metrics.

2) New Statistics row/table BELOW the chart:
   - Rows (metrics):
     • Price
     • Price / SqFt
     • Days on Market
     • (Add Beds/Baths/SqFt if available and helpful)
   - Columns:
     • Range
     • Average
     • Median
   - The metrics must be calculated from the selected comps dataset (post rental exclusion).
   - Separate Sold vs Active/UC handling if needed (ex: DOM rules differ).

Testing:
- CMA Results timeline shows dot plot.
- Statistics table displays correct Range/Avg/Median values.

====================================================
D) MARKET STATS — INVENTORY DIAL + ABSORPTION / MONTHS OF INVENTORY
====================================================

Goal:
Add a market “temperature” dial similar to the Quick CMA video’s client-friendly feel.

Requirements:
1) Add an Inventory Dial widget:
   - States: Hot → Neutral → Cool (visual dial/indicator)
2) Display these supporting metrics beneath:
   - Absorption rate: “X properties per month”
   - Inventory: “Y months”
   - Example format:
     “Absorption rate: 35 properties/month”
     “Inventory: 6.5 months (≈6)”
3) Computation must be documented:
   - Absorption rate based on recent sold/closed pace (choose a reasonable window, e.g., last 30/60/90 days).
   - Months of inventory = Active inventory / monthly absorption rate.
4) Ensure dataset excludes rentals/leasing and uses consistent status mapping.

Testing:
- Generate CMA → Market Stats shows dial + numbers.
- Values change when different market area/comps are selected.

====================================================
E) MARKET STATS — MAP OF PROPERTIES + YOY CHARTS
====================================================

Goal:
Add richer but still professional market analytics.

Requirements:
1) Map of properties (Market Stats):
   - Plot relevant properties (active/uc/sold comps) on a map.
   - Clicking opens floating card.
2) YoY statistics section:
   - Include Year-over-Year indicators (where possible):
     • YoY median sold price
     • YoY average sold price
     • YoY days on market (optional)
3) Add a graph:
   - Chart showing Average & Median sold price trend over time (monthly points or quarterly).
   - Label clearly and keep client-safe formatting.

Testing:
- Market Stats shows map + YoY metrics.
- Graph renders with realistic values and updates based on dataset.

====================================================
FINAL REQUIREMENTS (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
====================================================

1) Repliers only
- All property/comps/market data must come from Repliers.
- No MLS Grid labels unless Properties module truly uses MLS Grid.

2) Rental/Leasing exclusion
- Rentals/leasing must be excluded from:
  • comps selection
  • timeline stats
  • market stats
  • maps
  • absorption/inventory computations

3) Consistency
- The same selected comps dataset must drive:
  • Map markers
  • Timeline chart
  • Statistics table
  • Market Stats dial
  • YoY chart

====================================================
TESTING & REPORT

You MUST provide:
1) Screenshots/GIFs of:
   - Properties page floating buttons working (Send Properties → Seller Updates, Quick CMA → CMA)
   - CMA Map with comps plotted
   - Timeline dot plot + statistics table
   - Market Stats inventory dial + absorption/inventory values
   - YoY chart average vs median sold price

2) A short explanation of:

   - What time window was used (30/60/90 days)
   - How comps dataset is filtered and rental-excluded
