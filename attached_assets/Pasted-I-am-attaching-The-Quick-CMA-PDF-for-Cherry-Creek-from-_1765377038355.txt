I am attaching:

- The Quick CMA PDF for Cherry Creek from a 3rd-party system.
- Screenshots showing:
  • Cherry Creek property search results
  • Property detail page where images and details are missing

Please apply the following fixes based on these references.

==================================================
1) Property Images Missing (List View + Detail View)
==================================================

None of the property photos appear in the Properties → View Results page or the Property Detail page. Only placeholders are shown, even though Repliers provides real image URLs.

Fix required:
- Ensure normalized Repliers listings include a `photos` array (from `media`, `images`, or `photos`).
- Use `photos[0]` as the property card thumbnail.
- Display a full gallery in the property detail page.
- Use fallback placeholder **only when no photos exist**.

Update both:
- List view (Properties → View Results)
- Property detail view.

==================================================
2) Cherry Creek Search – Incorrect Behavior
==================================================

When searching subdivision **Cherry Creek**, the behavior is incorrect:

Expected (based on Quick CMA):
- Active: ≈3 listings
- AUC: ≈2 listings
Actual:
- App returns 0 or inconsistent listings.

Closed listings:
- App shows 16, but unsure if correct.

Fix required:
- Confirm subdivision filter uses: Subdivision LIKE "Cherry Creek%".
- Ensure status mapping correctly matches Repliers:
  • A = Active  
  • U = Active Under Contract  
  • P = Pending  
  • S = Sold  
- Ensure sqft filter (1200–1800) works.
- Ensure property subtype filter is correctly mapped (Single Family).

==================================================
3) CMA Math Must Match Quick CMA PDF
==================================================

The Quick CMA PDF (Cherry Creek, 1200–1800 sqft) shows:

- Avg Close Price ≈ $584,500  
- Median Close Price ≈ $570,000  
- Avg $/sqft ≈ $351.45  
- Median $/sqft ≈ $344.07  

Current CMA numbers are incorrect (e.g., $575K for comps worth $3M+), indicating:

- Wrong fields used
- Incorrect normalization
- Numeric values treated as strings

Fix required:
- Use correct Repliers fields:
  • `listPrice`
  • `closePrice`
  • `livingArea`
  • `beds`, `baths`
- Correct calculations:
  • Avg / Median price
  • Avg / Median $/sqft
  • Min / Max
  • DOM
- Only calculate stats from user-selected comps.
- Reproduce the Cherry Creek CMA from the PDF as validation.

==================================================
4) Missing Property Information (Detail Page)
==================================================
Sections are empty even though Repliers provides the data:

- Description  
- Features & Amenities  
- Property History  
- Neighborhood  

Fix required:
- Map correct fields:
  • Description → `publicRemarks`
  • Features & Amenities → `interiorFeatures`, `exteriorFeatures`, `communityFeatures`, `lotFeatures`, etc.
  • Property History → use available status/price changes or show a correct fallback.
  • Neighborhood → subdivision, MLS area, city, ZIP

==================================================
5) “Back to Search” Button Redirects Incorrectly
==================================================

Issue:
- On the property detail page, clicking **Back to Search** currently redirects to **Buyer Search**.
- Expected behavior: It should return to the **previous page within the Properties search results**, preserving the last filters and scroll position.

Fix required:
- Update routing so “Back to Search” returns to the user’s last Properties → View Results state.
- Ensure it does NOT redirect to Buyer Search.

==================================================
Summary of Required Fixes
==================================================

1. Fix property images in list + detail views using Repliers `photos[]`.  
2. Correct Cherry Creek search logic: subdivision, status, sqft, subtype.  
3. Fix CMA math and validate against the Quick CMA PDF.  
4. Populate missing property detail sections using correct Repliers fields.  
5. Fix “Back to Search” so it returns to Properties results, not Buyer Search.  
6. Keep UI unchanged—only fix data mapping, logic, and calculations.

Please use the attached PDF and screenshots to guide these fixes.
