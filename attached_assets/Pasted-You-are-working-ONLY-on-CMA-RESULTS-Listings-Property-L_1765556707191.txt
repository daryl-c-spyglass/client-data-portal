You are working ONLY on CMA RESULTS (Listings → Property Locations map, Timeline → Market Insights, and Print PDF).
Do NOT modify Dashboard, Properties search, Seller Updates, or IDX/public pages.

Data source: Repliers. Leasing/rentals excluded globally.

Implement the fixes below ONE BY ONE and test each before moving on.
The user will attach the same screenshots in Replit for reference.

====================================================
1) LISTINGS → PROPERTY LOCATIONS MAP: EMOJI COLORS MUST MATCH MARKET STATS
====================================================

Problem:
- Property Locations emoji markers in Listings are NOT using the same color variations as Market Stats.
- Screenshot #1 (Listings) vs Screenshot #2 (Market Stats) show inconsistent marker styling.

Requirements:
1) Make Listings → Property Locations map use the EXACT SAME marker styling system as Market Stats:
   - Same emoji marker type (house emoji)
   - Same color variation per status
   - Same legend colors and labels
2) Centralize marker style logic:
   - Create one shared function/component for map markers and reuse it in BOTH:
     a) Listings Property Locations map
     b) Market Stats Property Locations map
   - Do NOT duplicate marker styling in two places.
3) Status mapping must be consistent:
   - Active → Active styling
   - Under Contract / Pending → Pending styling
   - Sold/Closed → Sold styling
4) Ensure the legend matches the marker colors.

Testing (required):
- Open the same CMA and compare Listings map vs Market Stats map:
  - Marker colors match exactly.
  - Legend colors match exactly.
- Change Listings filter (All/Sold/Pending/Active):
  - Marker count changes and colors remain correct.

====================================================
2) TIMELINE → MARKET INSIGHTS: ADD YoY
====================================================

Requirement:
- In Timeline → Market Insights block, include a Year-over-Year (YoY) section.

YoY must include (at minimum):
- YoY Average Sold Price (%, up/down)
- YoY Median Sold Price (%, up/down)

Rules:
1) Use Repliers sold/closed dataset only (exclude rentals).
2) Define the YoY window consistently:
   - Compare last 12 months vs prior 12 months (preferred), OR
   - Compare same month vs same month last year (if your dataset is monthly).
3) Display format:
   - Clear label: “YoY”
   - Show % change with up/down indicator
   - If insufficient data, show “YoY: N/A” (not blank)

Testing:
- Load CMA Timeline:
  - YoY values display and are not blank.
  - Values change when different CMA dataset/area is used (if applicable).

====================================================
3) PRINT PDF: REMOVE YELLOW BOX + FIX BOTTOM CUT-OFF
====================================================

Problems:
- PDF still includes the yellow action bar/toolbar section (Save / Share CMA / Modify Search / etc.).
- PDF is still cut off at the bottom (content clipped).

Requirements:
1) Remove the yellow box from print output:
   - The entire action panel/toolbars/buttons must be hidden in print mode.
   - Use print-only CSS (e.g., @media print) to hide:
     - yellow toolbar/action row
     - any sticky UI bars
     - any “floating UI” elements
2) Fix bottom cut-off:
   - Ensure content flows across pages naturally.
   - Add proper page breaks for sections/cards.
   - Avoid fixed-height containers that clip content in print.
   - Remove/disable overflow scroll containers for print.
3) Make PDF look like a document (not a screenshot):
   - Correct margins/padding
   - No scrollbars/cursor artifacts
   - Consistent typography and spacing
4) Validate:
   - Ensure the “Statistics” section and any following blocks are fully visible (no truncation).

Testing (required):
- Print preview a CMA with multiple sections:
  - Yellow bar is NOT visible.
  - No bottom clipping.
  - Multi-page output works.
  - No scrollbars/cursor lines appear.

====================================================
FINAL REPORT REQUIRED
====================================================

Provide:
1) Confirmation marker styling is now shared and reused between Listings + Market Stats.
2) Screenshot proof that emoji colors match across both maps.
3) Screenshot proof of Timeline Market Insights showing YoY.
4) PDF before/after proof:
   - Yellow box removed
   - Bottom cut-off fixed
   - Document-like formatting achieved
