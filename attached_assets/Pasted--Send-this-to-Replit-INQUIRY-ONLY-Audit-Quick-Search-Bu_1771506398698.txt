## PART 1: Quick Search Component Audit

### QUESTIONS TO ANSWER

**1. Find the Quick Search Component**

- Which file contains the Quick Search input?
- Is it a separate component or inline in BuyerSearch.tsx?
- What library is used for autocomplete (custom, Radix, Shadcn Combobox, etc.)?

**2. Autocomplete Data Source**

- What API endpoint provides the suggestions?
- What parameters are sent (query, limit, etc.)?
- What fields are returned (address, mlsNumber, price, city, etc.)?
- How is the search query formatted for the API?

**3. Current Behavior on User Actions**

Document exactly what happens for each action:

| Action | What Happens? |
|--------|---------------|
| User types in input | ? |
| User clicks a suggestion | ? |
| User presses Enter without selecting | ? |
| User presses Enter after selecting | ? |
| User clears the input (X button) | ? |

**4. State Management**

- Where is the Quick Search value stored? (local state, URL params, context?)
- How does it interact with other filters?
- What state changes when a suggestion is selected?

**5. Integration with Search Execution**

- Does selecting a suggestion auto-trigger a search?
- Or does it just fill a filter that requires clicking "Search Properties"?
- Is there a difference between address search vs MLS# search?
- Does selecting a suggestion navigate to property detail, or stay on search page?

**6. Filter Chip Behavior**

- How is the `keywordSearch: ...` filter chip generated?
- What parameter does it map to in the API request?
- Can user remove it by clicking X?

## PART 2: Buyer Search UI/UX Audit

### QUESTIONS TO ANSWER

**1. Filter Sections Inventory**

List ALL filter sections in order from top to bottom:

```
| # | Section Name | Fields Count | Collapsed by Default? |
|---|--------------|--------------|----------------------|
| 1 | Quick Search | 1 | No |
| 2 | Status | 3 | No |
| 3 | ... | ... | ... |
```

**2. Total Scroll Depth**

- How many pixels/viewport heights to see ALL filters?
- Count total number of filter fields
- Count number of filter sections

**3. Required vs Optional Fields**

- Are ANY fields required to execute a search?
- Or can user search with zero filters applied?
- What is the minimum action to get results?

**4. Search Button Location**

- Where is the "Search Properties" button located?
- Is it visible without scrolling?
- Is there a sticky/fixed search button?
- Does the user need to scroll back up to click search after filling filters?

**5. Filter Priority Analysis**

Categorize filters by likely usage frequency:

**Essential (used almost every search):**
- [list]

**Common (used frequently):**
- [list]

**Advanced (used rarely):**
- [list]

**6. Collapsible Sections**

- Are filter sections collapsible?
- If yes, which are expanded by default?
- If no, should they be?

**7. Mobile Experience**

- How does the filter panel behave on mobile?
- Is it a sidebar, full-screen overlay, or inline?
- Can users easily access search results while adjusting filters?

**8. Current Pain Points**

Based on the code structure, identify:
- Do users have to scroll past rarely-used filters to find common ones?
- Is there a "Show More" / "Advanced Filters" toggle?
- Are related filters grouped logically?
- Is there visual hierarchy distinguishing important filters?

**9. AI-Powered "Describe Your Ideal Home" Feature**

- Is this feature functional?
- What does it do when user types a natural language query?
- Does it auto-fill filters or search directly?
